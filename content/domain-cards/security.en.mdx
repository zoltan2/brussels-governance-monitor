## RPD commitments

The Regional Policy Declaration of 13 February 2026 devotes an entire chapter to security, structured around several axes:

### Anti-drug efforts

- **Integrated regional drug plan** — chain approach (prevention, harm reduction, enforcement)

### Station security

- **€10 million** investment for Midi and Nord stations
- Coordination with police zones and SNCB

### CCTV and police coordination

- Integration of local CCTV systems into the Federal Police central system
- SAFE.Brussels platform interconnected with CGPI
- Possible police zone mergers (subject to federal vote)
- Local neighbourhood policing stations

### SIAMU (fire service)

- **Two phases of staff reinforcement**
- Improved working conditions

### Other measures

- Dedicated recruitment pathway for security professions targeting Brussels residents
- Combating street harassment, juvenile delinquency, violence against women and children
- Combating drug trafficking and radicalisation

## Sources and methodology
