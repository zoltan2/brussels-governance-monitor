## Context

Following the failure of the mediation, the Brussels Parliament designates a third formateur from Les Engages, a pivotal party present in several possible configurations. The mission begins on 15 November 2025, as the Region has been operating under a caretaker government for more than 17 months.

## The formula attempted

The formateur proposes an unprecedented coalition, nicknamed "Guinness" in the press in reference to the record duration of the crisis. This six-party formula attempts to combine centre-right and centre-left elements to build a majority in both linguistic groups, bringing in parties that had not yet been involved in previous attempts.

## Proceedings

The formateur adopts an accelerated negotiation method, with continuous sessions and deadlines imposed on parties to respond to successive notes. The pressure of time -- the Region approaching two years without a government -- serves as leverage.

Significant progress is made on the programme:
- Agreement on an emergency investment plan for housing
- Convergence on mobility policy
- Compromise on the multi-year budgetary framework

However, at the moment of finalising the agreement, a key Dutch-speaking partner refuses to commit, citing insufficient guarantees for its community in regional governance.

## Failure

On 20 January 2026, the third formateur submits his resignation to the president of the Brussels Parliament. The last-minute refusal by a Dutch-speaking partner derails a negotiation that was nevertheless the most advanced since the beginning of the crisis.

This attempt leaves a bitter taste: never had the parties been so close to an agreement. The government programme was virtually finalised, but the institutional question remains the sticking point.
