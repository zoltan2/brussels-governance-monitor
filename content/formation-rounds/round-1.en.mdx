## Context

Following the regional elections of 9 June 2024, the Brussels Parliament designates a first formateur from the MR, the party with the best score on the French-speaking side. The mission begins on 1 August 2024, after a brief informal exploratory phase.

## The formula attempted

The formateur attempts to transpose to Brussels the so-called "Arizona" coalition negotiated at federal level. This formula brings together the MR, Les Engages, CD&V and Vooruit. The idea is to create symmetry between the levels of government to facilitate negotiations.

## Proceedings

The formateur conducts intensive consultations with the parties concerned. Several formation notes are drafted, covering broad budgetary orientations, mobility and housing. However, a structural obstacle quickly emerges: the seat configuration in the Brussels Parliament does not allow this coalition to assemble a majority in each linguistic group.

## Failure

On 15 February 2025, the formateur submits his resignation to the president of the Brussels Parliament. The final report notes the impossibility of achieving the required majority in the Dutch-speaking linguistic group with the sole participation of CD&V and Vooruit, as certain elected representatives refuse to commit to this formula.

The attempt lasted more than six months, revealing the Brussels specificity: a coalition viable at federal level is not necessarily so at the regional level, due to the linguistic balances specific to the Brussels-Capital Region.
