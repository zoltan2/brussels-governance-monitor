Brussels regional elections are held every five years, simultaneously with the European elections and the elections of the other regional parliaments. They allow citizens of the Brussels-Capital Region to elect the 89 members of the Brussels Parliament. Voting follows a proportional list system.

The Brussels particularity lies in the fact that voters choose to cast their ballot on lists presented by French-speaking parties or by Dutch-speaking parties. This choice determines whether elected representatives belong to one of the two linguistic groups in Parliament. There is no sub-nationality in Brussels: the choice is electoral, not identity-based.

The results of regional elections determine the balance of power that will preside over coalition negotiations. The growing fragmentation of the Brussels political landscape, with the proliferation of parties represented in Parliament, makes coalition formation increasingly complex and partly explains the lengthening of formation periods documented by the Brussels Governance Monitor.
