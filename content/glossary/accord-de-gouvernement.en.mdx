The government agreement is the founding document of a coalition. Negotiated between the parties that will together form the government, it defines the broad political orientations, concrete commitments and budgetary priorities for the entire legislative term. It is the roadmap that the government pledges to follow.

Negotiating the government agreement is at the heart of the formateur's mission. It covers all regional competences: housing, mobility, the environment, employment, the economy and urban planning. Each party in the coalition seeks to include its programmatic priorities, which makes negotiations lengthy and complex. The final text represents a compromise between sometimes very different visions.

The absence of a government agreement during a prolonged formation period means that no shared political vision guides regional public action. Administrations operate on the basis of the previous government's orientations, unable to adapt to new challenges. That is why the conclusion of this agreement is a decisive step closely monitored by the Brussels Governance Monitor.
