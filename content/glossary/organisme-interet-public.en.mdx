Regional public interest bodies (OIP) are para-public entities with legal personality and management autonomy. They form the operational arm of the Brussels-Capital Region and implement regional policies in their respective areas. The main ones include: Actiris (employment), STIB/MIVB (public transport), Brussels Environment (environment and energy), perspective.brussels (territorial planning), Innoviris (research and innovation), citydev.brussels (economic development and housing), and Brussels Cleanliness Agency (waste management).

Each body operates on the basis of a management contract concluded with the regional government, which sets strategic objectives and financial resources for a given period. They have boards of directors or management and their own staff. Their technical expertise gives them an essential role in ensuring the continuity of public services.

During a formation crisis, these bodies continue to function and deliver existing services. However, management contracts that expire cannot be renewed by a caretaker government. New investments, strategic recruitment and structural reforms are frozen, leading to a gradual deterioration in the quality of services.
