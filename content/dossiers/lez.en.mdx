## Government agreement: what changes

The agreement of 12 February 2026 substantially modifies the LEZ regime:

- **Annual pass**: owners of non-compliant vehicles can purchase a pass at **350 EUR/year** (social rate **200 EUR**) to drive legally
- **Reduced fine**: the per-infraction fine is lowered from 350 to **80 EUR**
- **Cap removed**: the cap of 4 fines per year is removed

The LEZ is maintained in principle but its financial impact on motorists is significantly softened.

## Inherited context

Brussels' LEZ (Low Emission Zone) was established in 2018 to improve air quality by progressively banning the most polluting vehicles from the regional territory. The schedule provides for a gradual tightening of access standards, with the goal of banning diesel vehicles by 2030 and petrol vehicles by 2035.

## What was pending (June 2024 — February 2026)

The LEZ continued to operate under the rules already adopted. However, the next tightening phases required political decisions that could not be taken under caretaker government.

## Issues to monitor

- **Public health**: air quality in Brussels remains below WHO recommendations in several areas
- **Social justice**: the annual pass and social rate aim to mitigate the impact on low-income households
- **Climate coherence**: the relaxation of the fine regime raises questions about the trajectory for eliminating polluting vehicles
- **Tightening schedule**: the confirmation or revision of the 2025-2030 schedule remains to be decided
