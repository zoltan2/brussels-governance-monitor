## Coalition Agreement: Announced Commitments
The agreement of 12 February 2026 introduces a structural reform that directly impacts the digital sector:

- **Creation of BOSA Brussels**: merger of Talent, Brussels Finance, IBSA and **Paradigm** into a single entity. Paradigm, which carried the Smart City strategy, is integrated into this new administrative structure
- **20 to 30% reduction in operational costs** of merged structures (25 → 3 entities in total)

**Impact on the digital sector**: integrating Paradigm into BOSA Brussels means that the Smart City strategy will be carried by a generalist administrative entity rather than a dedicated body. This could rationalise resources but also dilute the digital priority. Governance details are not yet known.

## Digital divide and administrative Big Bang (February 2026)

### 40% digital vulnerability

According to data from Paradigm (formerly CIRB), over **300,000 Brussels residents** aged 16 to 74 are in a situation of **digital vulnerability**. This represents approximately 40% of this age group.

The **Digital Inclusion Plan**, funded at **EUR 900,000/year**, is built around 4 strategic pillars (raise awareness, federate, equip, support) and 66 concrete actions. A "Digital Brussels" call for projects is underway to reduce digital inequalities.

### Administrative Big Bang: from 25 to 4

The DPR announces the merger of **25 regional administrative entities into 4 pillars**. Paradigm (regional IT coordinator) is integrated into the BOSA Brussels pillar. This massive restructuring will directly impact:

- The Region's **IT infrastructure** (pooling of systems)
- **Data governance** (consolidation of regional databases)
- **Administrative simplification** (single digital window)
- **IT public procurement** (centralisation of purchases)

The timeline prioritises the implementation of pillars 1 and 2 from 2026, with the goal of **reducing operational costs by 20 to 30%**.
