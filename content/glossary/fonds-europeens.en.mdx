European funds are a significant source of financing for the Brussels-Capital Region. The Region benefits notably from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), which co-finance projects in the fields of innovation, employment, social inclusion and the ecological transition. These funds represent substantial amounts for regional policies.

Access to European funds is subject to strict conditions: the Region must submit approved operational programmes, meet programming deadlines and guarantee national co-financing. These requirements necessitate political and budgetary decisions that only a full government can take. Under a provisional twelfths regime, co-financing commitments become problematic.

The risk of losing access to certain European funds is one of the most tangible consequences of a prolonged formation crisis. European programming periods do not wait for the resolution of national political crises, and every delay can translate into a net loss of funding for the Region. This is an issue that the Brussels Governance Monitor follows closely in its analysis of the budgetary impact of the crisis.
