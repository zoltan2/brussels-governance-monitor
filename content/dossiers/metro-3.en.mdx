## Background

The Metro 3 project aims to extend Brussels' north-south metro line, connecting Albert station (Forest) to Bordet (Evere) via the city centre. It is the largest public transport infrastructure project in the Brussels-Capital Region.

The project is co-funded by the Region and the federal government through the Beliris cooperation agreement. This dual oversight means that any structural decision requires the agreement of both levels of government.

## Impact of the Crisis

In the absence of a fully empowered regional government, major budgetary decisions are frozen. The caretaker government cannot:

- Commit new multi-year budget allocations
- Arbitrate cost overruns related to inflation and delays
- Renegotiate the terms of the Beliris agreement

Preparatory works continue in part, but phases requiring new financial commitments are blocked.

## Key Issues

- **Mobility**: the Brussels metro network is at capacity during peak hours; the extension is designed to relieve northern tram and bus lines
- **Urban development**: planned stations are expected to catalyse urban development along the route
- **Cost of inaction**: each year of delay generates cost overruns due to materials inflation and prolonged mobilisation of project teams
