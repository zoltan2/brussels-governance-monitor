## A dense and vibrant municipality

Saint-Gilles is a dense municipality of nearly 50,000 inhabitants over 2.53 km², known for its cultural life and social diversity. The PS-Ecolo coalition was renewed for the 2024-2030 term. The PTB became the second political force (24.4%, 9 seats).

## Transparency: 3 out of 6 criteria

The **budget** is published online and the **mandate registry** is accessible via the transparency page. **Citizen participation** is active with the Citizen Budget Midi (EUR 300,000) and a permanent citizen council. However, no confirmed council **livestream**, **minutes** are only partially online, and no **Open Data** portal.

## Citizen participation: Citizen Budget Midi

Saint-Gilles stands out with its **Citizen Budget Midi** of EUR 300,000 via the 21solutions platform, garnering 6,738 votes. A **permanent citizen council** complements the participatory framework.
