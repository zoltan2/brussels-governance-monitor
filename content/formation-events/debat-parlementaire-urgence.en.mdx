## What happened

On 3 February 2026, the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region held an extraordinary plenary session devoted to the formation crisis. It was the first time the Parliament had organised a dedicated debate on the formation deadlock, under pressure from citizen mobilisation.

## The debate

The debate unfolded in two stages:

### State of play
The President of Parliament presented an overview of the five failed formation rounds, recalling the chronology and obstacles encountered at each stage. Group leaders spoke to set out their party's position.

### Proposals
Several members from different parties tabled a cross-party resolution calling for:

1. The exploration of all possible institutional formulas, including a government with a limited mandate
2. Consultation of the Council of State on the legal feasibility of a thematic emergency government
3. A binding timetable for the next phase of formation

## The points of convergence

Despite divisions, the debate revealed unprecedented points of convergence:

- A broad consensus on the budgetary emergency: all parties acknowledged that the provisional twelfths situation is untenable
- An openness to alternative formulas among parties that had previously insisted on a classical formation process
- A collective realisation that the crisis has reached a point of no return

## The significance

This debate marked a significant shift: Parliament actively took charge of the crisis rather than delegating it to formateurs or facilitators. The cross-party resolution, if adopted, could pave the way for a radically new approach.
