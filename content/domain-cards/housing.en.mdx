## Coalition Agreement: Announced Commitments
The agreement of 12 February 2026 provides for a massive unlocking for housing:

- **SLRB**: injection of **EUR 400 million**
- **1,000+ public housing units** over the parliamentary term
- **Be Home doubled**: 160 → **EUR 320/month**
- **Renolution replaced** by **zero-interest loans** (EUR 200 million envelope until 2029)
- **Brownfield sites**:
  - Wiels, Ajvil, Donderberg: **preserved**
  - **18-month moratorium**: Keyenbempt, Calevoet, Josaphat, Meylemeersch
  - Chant des Cailles + Dames Blanches: **confirmed**
  - **Neo (Heysel)**: relaunched
- **Simplification of urban planning procedures**

These commitments address the structural crisis documented below (62,234 households waiting, Housing Fund at a standstill, sharply rising rents). Their implementation will need to be monitored, particularly the SLRB's absorption capacity and the effective replacement of Renolution by zero-interest loans.

### Clearing the Renolution backlog

In February 2026, **EUR 56 million** was released to clear the outstanding Renolution applications:

- **EUR 50 million** via Urban.Brussels + **EUR 6 million** via Leefmilieu Brussel
- **2,692 applications** already validated (~EUR 41 million)
- **600+ applications** still to be processed by mid-2026
- All payments to be completed before end of 2026
- The new **zero-interest loan** system will take over from **2027** (EUR 66 million/year envelope)

## Inherited situation and contextual data

## A market under extreme pressure

Housing in Brussels has been in structural crisis for years. The absence of a regional government since June 2024 has turned a difficult situation into a deadlock: no new programme can be launched, no major investment decided, no reform adopted.

### The historic waiting list

At the end of 2025, **62,234 households** are registered on the waiting list for social housing — an all-time record. This represents **10% of all Brussels households**. The average waiting time is **9 to 13 years** depending on the type of housing requested.

The Brussels social housing stock comprises approximately 42,000 dwellings, managed by 16 Public Service Real Estate Companies (SISPs). The ratio is simple: there are more households waiting than existing dwellings.

### The rent gap

The gulf between the social and private markets illustrates the urgency:

- **Average social rent**: EUR 412/month (end of 2024)
- **Average private rent**: EUR 1,376/month (2025 contracts, +3.7% year-on-year, source Federia). No Brussels municipality has an average rent below EUR 1,000
- For a one-bedroom apartment: approximately EUR 1,110/month at the start of 2026

Half of Brussels households meet the eligibility criteria for social housing. Supply covers only a fraction of demand.

### A rental market seizing up

According to the **Federia Rental Barometer 2025** (published 11 February 2026, based on approximately 70,000 leases), the number of **new rental contracts signed via agencies fell by 10% in 2024** despite strong demand. The median apartment rent reached **EUR 1,213/month**, up **28% since 2021** (EUR 950). Federia points to a **"gradual disengagement of private investors"** that is reducing the supply of affordable housing.

The Brussels rental market, roughly 90% composed of apartments, shows signs of structural gridlock: landlords are reluctant to re-let amid regulatory uncertainty (rent control, outdated reference grid), while tenants stay put for lack of an affordable alternative. Finding housing below EUR 1,000/month has become "rare" in Brussels, including for studios and one-bedroom apartments.

### Overcrowding, a silent indicator

**31% of Brussels residents** live in overcrowded housing (insufficient rooms for household size), compared to 5.7% on average in Belgium. Brussels is the most overcrowded region in the country. This figure, stable for several years, reflects a structural shortage of affordable housing of adequate size.

### Purchase prices

The Brussels property market is equally strained. According to Statbel (Q3 2025):

- **Apartment** (median): **€274,550** in Brussels, compared to €255,000 in Belgium (+2.9% year-on-year)
- **Terraced house** (median): **€525,000**, compared to €280,000 in Belgium — i.e. **87% above** the national average
- **Detached house** (median): **€1,112,500**, compared to €390,000 in Belgium

Access to home ownership is all the more difficult given that 60% of Brussels households are renters (compared to 30% on average in Belgium) and that the Housing Fund, the main social lending instrument, has suspended its home purchase loans.

### Rent control (May 2025)

Since **1 May 2025**, the Brussels Housing Code imposes a reference framework for rents. Any rent exceeding the reference rent (calculated via the official loyers.brussels grid) by **more than 20%** is presumed abusive, with the burden of proof on the landlord.

However, the reference grid is based on surveys from 2017 to 2020, making it outdated: according to a Brussels Signal analysis, **more than 50% of current leases** would exceed the threshold and be technically "abusive" due to the gap between actual rents and the outdated grid.

## The Housing Fund at a standstill

On 1 July 2025, the Housing Fund **suspended all new credit applications**. The caretaker government refused a loan of EUR 50 million, with the budget minister citing the refusal to increase Brussels' debt.

### Services suspended then partially resumed

On 1 July 2025, all credits were suspended. Since **2 January 2026**, **Ecoreno** credits (energy renovation) have been reopened thanks to targeted refinancing. The following remain suspended until at least 31 March 2026:

- Home purchase mortgages
- ECORENO consumer credits
- Investment credits for co-ownerships

Approximately **50,000 households** in Brussels waiting for affordable housing are directly affected. Around twenty employees in the credit department were placed on temporary unemployment.

### Banking pressure

In November 2024, Belfius withdrew a EUR 500 million credit line from the Housing Fund. Other banks refused tenders "to send a signal to Brussels politicians". The Fund's credit risk has not changed — the pressure is political.

## Rental allowances paid late

In December 2024, approximately **6,000 recipients** did not receive their rental allowance on time. The cause: no budget adjustment had been prepared since May 2024 (election year). The coffers were empty. Payments were finally made in early January 2025 thanks to provisional twelfths.

## What has been done despite everything

- **2,000 new social housing units** delivered between 2020 and 2024
- **7,500 dwellings renovated** over the same period
- **2,327 families** housed in social housing in 2024
- **EUR 2 billion** invested in social housing 2020-2024
- The **tenancy reform** (Housing Code) entered into force on 1 November 2024, adopted before the elections

## What is blocked

- **Alliance Habitat**: new phases frozen (original target: 6,720 new public housing units for EUR 953 million)
- **New construction projects**: on hold even with permits obtained
- **Rental allowance reform**: no structural overhaul possible
- **PAD** (Master Development Plans): Gare du Midi, Heysel frozen
- **SLRB** carrying a debt of **195 million EUR**, forced to sell the Ariane and Palais sites (~52 million EUR), including nearly completed projects

## Why this matters

Housing is the largest expenditure item for Brussels households. When 10% of the population is waiting for social housing and the main financing tool is at a standstill, every month without a government deepens a social debt that will take years to address.
