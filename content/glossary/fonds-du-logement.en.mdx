The Housing Fund (French: Fonds du Logement) of the Brussels-Capital Region is a public interest body whose primary mission is to facilitate access to housing for low- and middle-income Brussels households. It grants mortgage loans on favourable terms and manages a stock of affordable rental housing.

Beyond mortgage loans, the Housing Fund is involved in producing new housing through the acquisition and renovation of buildings. It also offers social support services for borrowers in difficulty. Its work is essential in a Brussels property market where prices continue to rise.

During a caretaker period, the Housing Fund's activities continue but its capacity for intervention may be limited by the absence of new budgetary allocations or political decisions. The deadlock in government formation has a direct impact on housing policy, one of the major issues for the Brussels-Capital Region.
