## What happened

On Tuesday 10 February 2026 at 10:30 AM, negotiators from the 7 parties convene at the **University Foundation** (Rue d'Egmont, Brussels) for the first formation conclave in the history of the Brussels Region. Participants were instructed to book hotel rooms: negotiations will continue day and night until a framework agreement is reached.

## The format

The conclave is a binding negotiation format: party representatives are isolated from the outside world and do not leave the premises until an agreement is found. This format, inspired by the one that unlocked the federal formation, aims to force compromises.

**Working documents:**
- Budgetary framework targeting balance by 2029
- General policy statement covering the priorities of the future government

**Goal:** reach a framework agreement before the carnival break.

## The delegations

- **MR**: Valentine Delwart (delegation leader, positioned as potential Minister-President)
- **PS**: Ahmed Laaouej
- **Les Engagés**: Yvan Verougstraete
- **Groen**: Elke Van den Brandt
- **Vooruit**: Ans Persoons
- **Anders**: Frederic De Gucht
- **CD&V**: Benjamin Dalle

## The international context

Prime Minister **Bart De Wever** (N-VA) himself raised the Brussels crisis on the international stage: "Wherever I go in the world, in Europe, everyone asks me about it and says: 'What the hell is this mess?'". He emphasised that a 1989 law prevents federal intervention in Brussels budgetary matters.

## Situation

The conclave is **ongoing**. Utmost discretion has been requested from participants. No results have been communicated at the time of writing.
