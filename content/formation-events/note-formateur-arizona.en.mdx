## What happened

On 1 November 2024, the formateur tabled a detailed formation paper with the parties earmarked for the Brussels Arizona coalition. This document constituted the first concrete government programme proposal since the start of the formation process.

## The content of the paper

The paper covered the main areas of competence of the Brussels Region:

- **Budget**: plan to exit provisional twelfths with an austerity budget for the first two years, followed by a gradual relaunch of investment
- **Mobility**: continuation of the Good Move plan with adjustments, development of public transport
- **Housing**: refinancing of social housing policy, rent regulation
- **Employment**: strengthening of professional integration measures
- **Environment**: regional climate targets aligned with European commitments

## The reactions

The paper received a mixed reception. The Arizona coalition parties found positive elements, but reservations were expressed:
- Disagreements on the level of proposed budgetary austerity
- Disputes on the pace of implementation of certain reforms
- Above all, the question of the linguistic majority remained unresolved

The paper nevertheless marked an important milestone: for the first time, a concrete working document was on the table.
