The motion of no confidence (French: motion de mefiance) is a parliamentary instrument that allows the Brussels Parliament to end the regional government's mandate by formally withdrawing its confidence. In accordance with the principle of the constructive motion of no confidence, inspired by the German model, this motion must obligatorily present a successor candidate for the position of Minister-President.

This mechanism aims to prevent power vacuums: a government cannot be overthrown without simultaneously proposing a new one. The motion must be signed by a minimum number of members and can only be voted on after a cooling-off period. It must obtain the absolute majority of Parliament members to be adopted.

In the Brussels institutional context, recourse to a motion of no confidence is exceptionally rare. Government crises more often result from the disintegration of a coalition than from a formal vote of no confidence. Nevertheless, the threat of a motion of no confidence can play a role in political dynamics and negotiations between coalition partners.
