## The most populated and most transparent municipality

The City of Brussels is the capital municipality of the Brussels-Capital Region and the most populated of the 19 municipalities, with nearly 200,000 inhabitants spread across a territory of 33 km² encompassing the historic Pentagon, Laeken, Neder-Over-Heembeek, and Haren.

In terms of transparency, the City of Brussels stands as a **pioneer** among Brussels municipalities. It meets all six BGM monitoring criteria.

## Open Data: a portal since 2014

The City of Brussels has had an active Open Data portal since **2014**, among the first in Belgium at the municipal level. The portal offers datasets on mobility, urban planning, demographics, and municipal finances in exploitable formats (CSV, JSON, API).

## Citizen participation: faireBXLsamen

The **faireBXLsamen** platform ("making Brussels together") allows residents to propose, debate, and vote on municipal projects. Participatory budgets, consultations on urban planning, and citizen interpellations are accessible online. More than 100 projects have been submitted since its launch.

## Municipal council livestream

Municipal council sessions are broadcast via **livestream** on YouTube, and minutes are published in full online. Video archives go back several years.

## Digital communication

In November 2024, the City of Brussels decided to **leave X/Twitter**, refocusing its communication on official channels (website, newsletter, institutional social media). This decision, motivated by the degradation of the platform, makes the City of Brussels one of the first Belgian administrations to take this step.
