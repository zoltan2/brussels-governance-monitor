## What is blocked

### Metro 3 — North-South Line

The Metro 3 project aims to create a new metro line connecting the north of Brussels (Bordet) to the south (Albert). The total cost of the project is now estimated at **EUR 4.6 billion**. The first construction phases (converting existing pre-metro to full metro between Albert and Gare du Nord) are underway, supported by a **EUR 475 million loan from the European Investment Bank** (EIB).

However, a **special commission of the Brussels Parliament** (end of 2025) revealed a **255% budget overrun** compared to the initial budget, with the delivery horizon pushed back to **2034 at the earliest**.

Furthermore, the **Council of State suspended the planning permit** for the demolition-reconstruction of the Palais du Midi (ruling of 18 December 2025). The Region had violated heritage protection rules by granting the permit before the heritage assessment. Works planned for February 2026 cannot proceed. The case was brought by ARAU and Inter-Environnement Bruxelles.

The extension to Bordet (the most ambitious part) requires new political decisions:

- Budget reassessment and financial sustainability review
- Approval of the definitive route north of Schaerbeek
- Coordination with Master Development Plans (PAD)

Without a full government, these decisions cannot be taken.

### Road tunnels -- the Loi-Belliard case

Brussels has more than 30 road tunnels, several of which require major renovation. The most emblematic case is the **Loi-Belliard tunnel**: planning permits have been obtained, the budget of **161 million EUR** has been identified, but the works cannot begin without a full government to commit the expenditure.

The Stephanie and Bailli tunnels are also among the priorities. Routine maintenance continues (carried out by the administration), but major structural renovation projects require:

- A multi-year budget commitment (envelopes of several tens of millions of euros per tunnel)
- A political choice on priorities
- Often, coordination with other projects (Good Move, cycling infrastructure)

### Good Move — Regional Mobility Plan

Good Move is the regional mobility plan adopted in 2020. The neighbourhood zones already implemented continue to function. However, **the rollout of new neighbourhood zones and adjustments based on citizen feedback** require government decisions. In caretaker mode, only minor adjustments are possible.

## What continues to function

- **STIB**: daily operations (bus, tram, metro) continue normally under the 2024-2028 management contract. Fares increased by 1.23% on 1 February 2026 (single ride: EUR 2.40, annual pass: EUR 560)
- **Villo** and **Jump/Lime**: shared mobility services under existing concessions
- **Routine road maintenance**: potholes, signage, traffic lights
- **Already approved works**: construction sites launched before June 2024 continue

## Why this matters

Mobility is the most visible domain for Brussels residents in their daily lives. Each day of delay in infrastructure projects has a cost:

- Economic cost (congestion, time lost)
- Environmental cost (delay in the transition to public transport)
- Social cost (accessibility of underserved neighbourhoods)

Precise data on these costs is difficult to estimate as it depends on complex modelling. BGM does not publish a quantified estimate of the economic cost of these delays to avoid unsourced speculation.
