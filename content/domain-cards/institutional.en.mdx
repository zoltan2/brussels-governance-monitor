## Upcoming institutional milestones

The institutional timetable is tight. The agenda for the plenary session of 23 February has been officially published by the Brussels Parliament:

- **Monday 23 February** — the Minister-President presents the Regional Policy Declaration (RPD) to the Brussels Parliament (item 1: RPD, item 2: general debate)
- **Wednesday 25 February** — confidence vote in the Brussels Parliament

These two milestones will mark the formal start of the government's mandate and the entry into force of the legislative programme.

### Brussels Francophone Parliament (PFB) agenda

The Brussels Francophone Parliament (COCOF assembly) also has a busy schedule:

- **Monday 23 February at 4:30pm**: presentation of the COCOF Declaration of Community Policy (DCP) in PFB plenary session
- **Wednesday 25 February at 9:30am and 2:30pm**: debate and vote on the COCOF DCP

Tensions between PS and Les Engages over the **PFB presidency** remain unresolved at this stage.

## Bilingualism: commitment and controversy

The RPD lists bilingualism as an institutional priority. The Minister-President publicly acknowledged his insufficient command of Dutch, stating he owes it to Brussels residents to improve. The Dutch-language press covered this issue extensively, highlighting its significance in an officially bilingual region. The issue remains sensitive in the Brussels-Capital Region, where institutional bilingualism is a legal obligation.

The delay in finalising the Dutch-language version of the RPD — still unavailable five days after the agreement, according to BRUZZ (17 February 2026) — has reignited the debate on institutional bilingualism. The language question remains a structural issue in Belgium: the 1831 Constitution only received an official Dutch text in 1967 — for 136 years, only the French text had legal standing. The German version was not adopted until 1991.

## COCOF presidency

On 20 February 2026, the COCOF college validated the Declaration of Community Policy. **Ahmed Laaouej** (PS) is minister-president of the COCOF, in keeping with the convention that assigns this position to the second Francophone party in the coalition. The community majority is composed of MR, PS and Les Engagés. Laaouej's COCOF portfolios cover social cohesion, culture, social action and international relations.
