The "BGM estimate" label is a confidence level used by the Brussels Governance Monitor for information that does not come directly from an official institutional source. It applies to data derived from the BGM's own analysis, cross-referencing media sources, interpreting public statements or projections based on observed trends.

This confidence level does not mean the information is unreliable, but rather that it carries a degree of uncertainty inherent to its nature. A BGM estimate may concern, for example, the assessment of negotiations progress, the probability of certain coalition scenarios, or the projected impact of a budgetary situation on public services. The BGM strives to base its estimates on verifiable factual elements.

The distinction between official source and BGM estimate is a central element of the project's transparency policy. It allows readers to calibrate their own judgement according to the degree of certainty of the information. The BGM is committed to always clearly indicating the nature of its sources, so that each reader can assess the scope of the information presented.
