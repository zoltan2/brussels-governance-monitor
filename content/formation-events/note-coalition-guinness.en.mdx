## What happened

On 10 December 2025, the third formateur tabled a comprehensive formation paper for the so-called "Guinness" coalition. The nickname, coined by the press, referred to the record-breaking duration of the Brussels formation crisis. The paper represented the most developed government programme since the start of the process.

## The content of the paper

The "Guinness" paper stood out from previous proposals by its comprehensiveness:

- **Emergency investment plan**: a catch-up programme of 500 million euros over the legislative term to compensate for the delays accumulated during the provisional twelfths
- **Housing**: creation of 5,000 additional public housing units, rent regulation, renovation of the existing stock
- **Mobility**: refinancing of the STIB, tram network extension, acceleration of the Good Move plan
- **Budget**: gradual exit from provisional twelfths with a transitional budget for the first semester
- **Governance**: reinforced linguistic consultation mechanisms, inspired by the royal facilitator's proposal

## The reception

The paper received a broadly positive reception from all six parties. Several observers spoke of a historic breakthrough. The broad budgetary lines were accepted by all partners. The allocation of portfolios was sketched out. All that remained was to finalise the last arbitrations and confirm each party's commitment.
