## Government agreement: what changes

The agreement of 12 February 2026 announces the replacement of Good Move:

- **New Regional Mobility Plan** — new name, fundamental revision
- **Smaller cells** centred on **school zones** (road safety, quality of life around schools)
- **Removal of contested bollards** opposed by motorists and some shopkeepers
- **2nd car-free Sunday** per year (Iris week)
- Annual road budget: **+40 M EUR/year** for road resurfacing and public space improvements

The new plan retains the philosophy of calmed traffic but reduces its scale and prescriptive nature.

## Reactions and analysis

The announcement prompted divergent readings within the coalition itself. The outgoing Mobility Minister (Groen) speaks of an evolution towards "Better Move" with "the same dynamics and objectives", while the formateur (MR) maintains it is "in any case a new plan".

The Citizens' Committee Against Good Move rejected the agreement, calling the changes "essentially semantic": "A name change does not change a philosophy." The committee criticises the retention of the fundamental principles (circulation cells, STOP principle, prescriptive mobility vision) and considers that "reducing the size of the cells does not correct an approach that has demonstrated its limitations."

## Inherited context

Good Move was the regional mobility plan adopted by the Brussels government in 2020. It aimed to reorganise traffic in Brussels neighbourhoods through "neighbourhood cells" (low-traffic zones), the expansion of the cycling network, improvements to public transport, and a reduction in the space allocated to cars in the city.

The plan had sparked controversy in several communes, with local opposition to the implementation of neighbourhood cells.

## What was blocked (June 2024 — February 2026)

- Decisions on priority neighbourhoods for the next cells
- Investments in associated cycling infrastructure and public transport
- Regional coordination with communes that contested the plan
- The official evaluation of cells already deployed

Some communes continued to apply cells already in place, but no new regional rollout could be decided.

## Issues to monitor

- **Transition**: the fate of the neighbourhood cells already deployed (~10) under Good Move — will they be maintained, modified or removed?
- **School zones**: the scope and modalities of the new cells centred on schools
- **Name of the new plan**: the new Regional Mobility Plan does not yet have an official name
- **Municipal coordination**: the success of the new plan will depend on buy-in from all 19 communes
- **Road safety**: Brussels remains one of Belgium's most accident-prone cities for pedestrians and cyclists
- **Avenue Broustin (Jette)**: the municipality has issued a formal notice to the Region to reopen the avenue, closed to traffic since 2021-2022 as part of a Good Move neighbourhood cell. 70% of local residents oppose the closure. Jette considers the trial phase to have far exceeded its timeframe and threatens legal action
