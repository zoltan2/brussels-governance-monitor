## What happened

On 10 January 2026, as the formateur was about to submit the final agreement of the "Guinness" coalition for ratification by the six parties, a key Dutch-speaking partner announced its refusal to commit. This reversal came after weeks of negotiations that appeared to be leading to a conclusion.

## The stated reasons

The Dutch-speaking partner justified the refusal on the following grounds:

- Guarantees deemed insufficient for the Dutch-speaking community in the regional governance mechanisms
- Reservations about certain aspects of the allocation of ministerial portfolios
- Pressure from the party base hostile to entering a Brussels government under these conditions

## The shockwave

This refusal triggered a considerable shockwave:

- **In the political world**: frustration was immense among the five other parties, which had accepted painful compromises to reach an agreement
- **In public opinion**: reactions of anger and discouragement were expressed, many considering the formation to be hostage to partisan considerations
- **In the media**: numerous editorialists described the moment as a breaking point in the Brussels crisis

## The significance

This last-minute refusal illustrated the fragility of the formation process: a single party can undo months of negotiations. It also raised the question of the viability of the current Brussels governance model, where the requirement for a majority in each linguistic group gives considerable blocking power to small parties.
