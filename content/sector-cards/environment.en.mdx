## Coalition Agreement: Announced Commitments
The agreement of 12 February 2026 profoundly transforms environmental mechanisms:

- **Renolution replaced** by **zero-interest loans** (EUR 200 million envelope until 2029) -- the ~15,000 pending applications will need to be processed under this new regime
- **LEZ maintained**: the schedule for future phases is unchanged
- **Brownfield sites**: Wiels, Ajvil, Donderberg **preserved**; 18-month moratorium on Keyenbempt, Calevoet, Josaphat, Meylemeersch
- **Vivaqua-Hydria merger**: water management consolidated into a single operator, recapitalisation of **EUR 180 million** (Region at 49.99%)
- **EUR 30 million** for the water merger transition

**Open question**: the shift from grants (Renolution) to zero-interest loans fundamentally changes the incentive for energy renovation. Low-income households, who cannot borrow even at zero interest, risk being excluded from the scheme. The impact on the ~75% of poorly insulated buildings remains to be assessed.

## LEZ 2026: results and new phase

### Strengthening on 1 January 2026

Since **1 January 2026**, the low-emission zone (LEZ) bans access for:

- **Diesel Euro 5** (registered between 2011 and 2016)
- **Petrol Euro 2** (registered between 1996 and 2001)

Around **400,000 vehicles** are affected at national level (Febiac estimate). A 3-month grace period applies: the first check results in a warning, the EUR 350 fine only applying from April 2026.

### Measured results

Since its introduction in 2018, the LEZ has produced significant results for air quality:

| Pollutant | Reduction |
|-----------|-----------|
| Nitrogen oxides (NOx) | **−55%** |
| Fine particles (PM) | **−33%** |
| Black carbon | **−60%** |

### Support: Bruxell'Air

Brussels residents who give up their vehicle can benefit from the **Bruxell'Air premium**: a mobility budget covering public transport, shared cars, cycling or taxis.
