The Brussels Parliament is the legislative assembly of the Brussels-Capital Region. It is composed of 89 members, directly elected by Brussels citizens in regional elections. These members are divided into two linguistic groups: the French linguistic group (72 members) and the Dutch linguistic group (17 members).

The Parliament exercises three main functions: legislative (it votes ordinances), budgetary (it approves the regional budget) and oversight (it monitors the government's actions through questions, interpellations and committees). Certain matters require a special majority in each linguistic group, a mechanism designed to protect the Dutch-speaking minority.

During a formation crisis, Parliament continues to function but its action is limited by the absence of a full government capable of submitting new draft ordinances. Parliamentary oversight of a caretaker government also encounters practical difficulties, as the government cannot commit to new orientations.
