## Coalition Agreement: Announced Commitments
The agreement of 12 February 2026 introduces a structural reform that directly impacts the digital sector:

- **Creation of BOSA Brussels**: merger of Talent, Brussels Finance, IBSA and **Paradigm** into a single entity. Paradigm, which carried the Smart City strategy, is integrated into this new administrative structure
- **20 to 30% reduction in operational costs** of merged structures (25 → 3 entities in total)

**Impact on the digital sector**: integrating Paradigm into BOSA Brussels means that the Smart City strategy will be carried by a generalist administrative entity rather than a dedicated body. This could rationalise resources but also dilute the digital priority. Governance details are not yet known.

## Inherited situation and contextual data

## A strategic sector for the future of Brussels

The technology and digital sector is a growing pillar of the Brussels economy. With approximately **40,000 direct jobs** and an ecosystem of **over 1,200 startups**, Brussels has positioned itself as a digital hub in Europe. The presence of European institutions and international organisations strengthens the Region's attractiveness for technology companies.

The sector depends on several regional mechanisms: the **Smart City strategy**, **digital inclusion subsidies**, **startup incentives** managed by Innoviris and hub.brussels, and the **digitalisation of public services**.

Between 9 June 2024 and 14 February 2026, the caretaker regional government could no longer take new structural decisions in these areas.

## Smart City strategy: an interrupted vision

### The mechanism

Brussels' Smart City strategy aimed to integrate digital technologies into urban management: smart mobility, data management, connected public services, digital citizen participation. This framework plan defined investments and priorities to make Brussels a smart and inclusive city.

### What is blocked

Under the caretaker government, no new strategic initiatives could be launched. In practice:

- **No new smart city projects** (urban sensors, open data, participatory platforms)
- **No adaptation** of the plan to rapid technological developments (artificial intelligence, cybersecurity)
- **No new public-private partnerships** in the digital domain
- **No funding** for new regional digital infrastructure

## Digital inclusion: vulnerable populations left waiting

### The stakes

Brussels has a significant proportion of residents in situations of digital vulnerability: elderly people, low-skilled individuals, newcomers. Regional digital inclusion programmes fund training, public digital spaces and support schemes.

### What is frozen

- **No new calls for projects** for organisations active in digital inclusion
- **No expansion** of public digital spaces in disadvantaged neighbourhoods
- **No adaptation** of programmes to new needs (mandatory online administration, post-COVID digital divide)
- **No strengthening** of partnerships with CPAS/OCMW social welfare centres and municipalities

Grassroots organisations such as BeCode reported a growing need for digital training that existing resources could not meet.

## Startup incentives: a weakened ecosystem

### The context

The Brussels startup ecosystem developed thanks to a range of regional instruments: pre-activity grants, Innoviris innovation premiums, hub.brussels support, and Region-backed incubators.

### Consequences of the freeze

- **No new programmes** for innovation support adapted to current technological trends
- **No revaluation** of grant and premium amounts against inflation
- **No new agreements** with incubators and accelerators
- **No regional strategy** for attracting international technology talent

Innoviris continued to fund projects approved before June 2024, but could not launch new large-scale calls for projects.

## Digitalisation of public services: modernisation on pause

Brussels' regional administrations had begun an extensive digitalisation programme. Under the caretaker government:

- **New digitalisation projects** (single digital window, regional digital identity) were suspended
- **Major IT public procurement** could not be launched
- **Digital training** for civil servants was limited to existing programmes
- **Interoperability** between the systems of different Brussels administrations stagnated

## What continues to function

### Technology companies

Technology companies established in Brussels continued their activities normally. The private digital market was not directly affected by the caretaker government, although the absence of an active regional policy reduced the territory's attractiveness.

### University research

Brussels universities continue their research programmes in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and big data. Projects funded by European programmes (Horizon Europe) are unaffected.

### Existing digital services

Regional digital platforms and services already deployed continue to function with existing maintenance budgets.

## Impact on the ground

The freeze on regional mechanisms had concrete consequences for the digital sector:

- **Weakened startup ecosystem**: without new incentives, Brussels startups are disadvantaged compared to Flemish and Walloon ecosystems
- **Widening digital divide**: vulnerable populations lack training and support
- **Technological lag**: the Smart City strategy falls behind other European capitals
- **Declining attractiveness**: international digital talent turns to regions offering more active support

## Outlook

The Brussels digital sector has structural assets: the European presence, a quality university pool, cultural diversity conducive to innovation. But these assets are not sufficient without an active regional policy of support and development.

Each month without a regional digital strategy represented accumulated delay compared to cities such as Amsterdam, Berlin or Lisbon, which were investing heavily in their digital transformation.
