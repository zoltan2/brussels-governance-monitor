## Key data

Brussels has approximately **163,000 people aged 65 and over**, representing **13%** of the regional population (1,255,795 inhabitants as of 1 January 2025). This proportion is significantly lower than the Belgian average (~20%), but ageing is progressing: projections from the Federal Planning Bureau place the share of 65+ at **19%** by 2071.

Among those aged 65+, people **aged 80 and over** account for 4% of the total population and 28% of the 65+ cohort. This ratio — the intensity of ageing — is rising (26% in 1991).

**13%** of Brussels residents aged 65+ receive **GRAPA** (Guaranteed Income for Elderly Persons), amounting to approximately 20,583 people (January 2022). This is three times more than in Flanders (4%) and more than double the rate in Wallonia (5%). The gap between municipalities is considerable: from 4% in Woluwe-Saint-Pierre to 26% in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode.

## Coverage in the DPR

The Regional Policy Declaration (DPR) of 13 February 2026 addresses seniors in chapter 11 (Social / Health), without a dedicated section. The identified measures:

- **Home care**: strengthened structural support for elderly people or those losing autonomy
- **Informal caregivers**: respite schemes, administrative simplification
- **Alternatives to nursing homes**: development envisaged (without further details)
- **Multidisciplinary facilities**: nursing homes are mentioned in a list alongside medical centres and hospitals

The DPR mentions neither Iriscare, nor the ongoing accreditation standards reform, nor the Allocation for Assistance to Elderly Persons (APA), nor the autonomy insurance scheme. No specific budget is allocated to these measures, and no quantified targets are set.

For comparison, Iriscare's institutional funding for elderly care facilities amounts to approximately **541 million EUR** in 2024 (Iriscare annual report). The APA represents an additional **35.4 million EUR**.

In Belgium, 13.3% of the population aged 15 and over is an informal caregiver, with a peak among 55-64 year-olds (23.2%) — national data from Sciensano (health survey 2023-2024). No regional breakdown for Brussels is available.

## Institutional housing

### Capacity and occupancy

Iriscare counts **211 elderly care facilities** in the Brussels-Capital Region, including 119 nursing homes. **11,592 people** reside in them:

- **70%** are women
- **53%** are aged 85 or over
- **~49%** receive the increased reimbursement

The private commercial sector holds **62%** of accredited beds; the public and non-profit sector accounts for 38%.

### Nursing home prices

Since February 2026, Iriscare publishes comparative price data by facility:

| | Public | Private commercial |
|---|---|---|
| **Average daily price** | **59.46 EUR** | **87.12 EUR** |
| Public allowance (Iriscare funding) | 65.30 EUR | 65.30 EUR |

Base prices excluding supplements (laundry, hairdresser, activities).

The daily allowance has increased by **40.88%** since the transfer of competence in 2019 (46.35 EUR/day → 65.30 EUR/day).

### Ongoing reform

New **accreditation standards** came into force on 1 September 2024 (decree of the Joint College (Collège réuni) of 18 January 2024). They mark the shift from a care-centred model to a resident-centred model (autonomy, participation, quality of life).

Other reform measures:
- **Fire safety standards**: existing facilities must obtain an A or B certificate by **1 September 2026**
- **Recovery of unoccupied beds**: 50% of vacant beds on average expire automatically every 15 April
- **Reactivation staff**: 18 million EUR/year for physiotherapists, psychologists, speech therapists, dietitians and educators
- **Unlimited accreditation** (previously 6 years maximum) and intermediate sanctions (fines, suspension)

## Allocation for Assistance to Elderly Persons (APA)

The APA is a monthly allowance paid to persons aged 65 and over with reduced autonomy (minimum score of 7 points on the autonomy reduction scale). Maximum amount: **594 EUR/month**.

| Indicator | Value | Period |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Active APA cases | 8,596 | 31 December 2024 |
| Applications received | 4,498 | Year 2024 |
| Total APA expenditure | 35,386,308 EUR | Year 2024 |

The APA is a competence transferred from the federal level to COCOM on 1 January 2019. Data is published by stat.iriscare.brussels (socio-demographic profile and expenditure trends).

## Senior employment

### Unemployment among 55+

Actiris publishes monthly unemployment statistics by age group (55-59, 60-64, 65+) and by municipality via the ViewStat tool. The 50+ age bracket is also available as an aggregate.

### Flexi-jobs

Flexi-jobs are growing markedly among the 65+ age group: **+52.6%** in 2024 according to ONSS. Those aged 65+ account for 18.7% of all flexi-workers, but 29.2% of work volume (ONSS data, broken down by age and region, updated quarterly).

## Distribution of competences

| Level | Competences | Actor |
|--------|------------|--------|
| COCOM / Iriscare | Nursing homes (accreditation, standards, funding), APA, bi-communal home care, assisted living | Iriscare |
| COCOF | Personal assistance (French-speaking side), French-speaking home care services | Min. Lalieux (PS) — Health |
| VGC | Personal assistance (Dutch-speaking side) | VGC |
| Region | Adapted housing (SLRB), mobility (STIB fares), 55+ employment (Actiris) | Various |
| 19 Municipalities / CPAS | Social restaurants, isolation action plans, senior housing, financial assistance (RIS), local care | 19 CPAS |
| Federal | Pensions, GRAPA, flexi-jobs, social security | FPS Social Security, ONSS |

The competent regional minister is Ahmed Laaouej (PS) — Social Action and Solidarity (Region) and Health and Social Action (COCOM / Joint College). No ministerial portfolio explicitly mentions seniors or Iriscare.

## Issues to monitor

- **Fire safety standards (1 September 2026)**: how many facilities will have obtained the A or B certificate on time?
- **Bed recovery**: what impact on total supply? Has the temporary suspension of the mechanism been extended?
- **COCOF DPR**: the text, not yet public as of 22 February 2026, may contain additional commitments regarding the elderly
- **Demographic projections**: the share of 65+ will rise from 13% to 19% by 2071 — are housing and care capacities calibrated accordingly?
- **APA**: trends in applications and expenditure in the context of population ageing

## What the data does not show

Certain dimensions of ageing in Brussels lack structured public data:

- **Social restaurants**: each CPAS manages its own facilities. No aggregated data on supply, attendance or user profiles is published at the regional level.
- **Social isolation among seniors**: there is no barometer specific to Brussels. Available data is fragmented — the King Baudouin Foundation estimates that 21% of people aged 60+ in Belgium are at risk of isolation (2025 barometer). Statbel measures loneliness in the general population (4.8% in Brussels, Q3 2024). An academic study places objective isolation among Brussels residents aged 65+ at 29%, compared to 24% in Wallonia and 21% in Flanders.
- **Scams and fraud targeting seniors**: the federal police publishes cybercrime statistics (64,995 offences in 2024) but does not break them down by victim age.
- **Informal caregivers in Brussels**: only national data exists (Sciensano: 13.3% of the population aged 15+). No Brussels-specific breakdown is published.
