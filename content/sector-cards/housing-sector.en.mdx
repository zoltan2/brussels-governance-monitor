## Housing, the primary concern of Brussels residents

Housing is the primary concern of residents of the Brussels-Capital Region. With rents among the highest in Belgium and a structurally insufficient social housing stock, the Brussels housing crisis is a long-standing challenge that the current political crisis is making worse.

The sector depends on several regional mechanisms: **social housing construction programmes** led by the SLRB/BGHM, **rent regulation**, the **investment plan** for renovating the existing social housing stock, and **urban renovation contracts** that incorporate affordable housing.

Since 9 June 2024, the caretaker regional government can no longer take new structural decisions on housing.

## Social housing construction: supply stagnates

### The mechanism

The SLRB/BGHM (Brussels Regional Housing Corporation) coordinates regional social housing policy. It oversees the 16 SISP (public housing companies) that manage approximately **40,000 social housing units**. New construction programmes are decided and funded at the regional level.

### What is blocked

With over **50,000 households** on the social housing waiting list, the need for construction is massive. Under a caretaker government:

- **No new social housing construction programmes**
- **No new land** identified or acquired for construction
- **No public-private partnerships** for mixed housing projects
- **No revision** of allocation criteria to respond to emergency situations

Projects already committed before June 2024 continue, but the pipeline for new projects is empty.

## Rent regulation: the status quo

### The stakes

Brussels is the only Belgian Region where the question of rent regulation has been politically discussed. The indicative rent grid, a non-binding reference tool, was due to be strengthened. The Brussels rental framework also required adaptations to protect tenants from rising rents.

### What is suspended

- **No strengthening** of the indicative rent grid
- **No introduction** of a binding rent regulation mechanism
- **No adaptation** of legislation on primary residence leases
- **No new measures** to protect against abusive evictions

The rental framework remains as it was before June 2024, with no adaptation to market developments.

## SLRB/BGHM investment plan: renovation slows

### The context

Brussels' social housing stock is ageing. Many units require significant renovation work: thermal insulation, safety compliance, replacement of technical installations. The SLRB/BGHM's multi-year investment plan provided for an ambitious renovation programme.

### The consequences

- The **investment plan** cannot be renewed or extended
- **Renovation budgets** are limited to already approved allocations
- **Emergency repairs** are maintained, but major renovations are postponed
- The **energy performance** of the social housing stock stagnates while energy costs rise

Social housing tenants bear the direct consequences of this freeze: poorly insulated units, high energy bills, persistent damp problems.

## Urban renovation contracts: forgotten neighbourhoods

Urban renovation contracts are an essential tool of Brussels' urban policy. They enable the revitalisation of disadvantaged neighbourhoods by combining affordable housing construction, public space renovation and creation of community facilities. Under a caretaker government:

- **No new urban renovation contracts**
- **No funding** for new housing projects in targeted neighbourhoods
- **No strengthened coordination** between regional and municipal levels
- **No structural response** to gentrification and social mix challenges

Source: Perspective.brussels, urban renovation contracts review, 2024.

## What continues to function

### Management of the existing stock

The 16 SISP continue to manage the approximately 40,000 existing social housing units. Allocation of vacant units, routine maintenance and rent collection continue normally.

### Lease contracts

Existing lease contracts, both in the social and private sectors, remain fully in force. The rights and obligations of tenants and landlords are not affected by the caretaker government.

### Housing allowances

Housing allowances (rent subsidies) already granted continue to be paid within existing budgets.

## The disengagement of private investors

The **Federia Barometre des locations 2025** (published 11 February 2026) confirms a worrying trend: estate agents signed **10% fewer rental contracts in 2024**, despite sustained demand. Federia identifies a **"progressive disengagement of private investors"** from the Brussels rental market.

This decline is explained by a combination of factors:
- **Regulatory uncertainty**: rent control (May 2025) and the outdated reference grid (2017-2020 data) create legal ambiguity
- **Punitive taxation**: registration duties remain at 12.5% in Brussels, compared to 3% in Wallonia and 2% in Flanders
- **Political paralysis**: the absence of a government prevents any adaptation of the regulatory framework

The median apartment rent reached **1,213 euro/month** at end 2025, up 28% since 2021. Finding housing under 1,000 euro/month has become rare, including for studios.

## Impact on the ground

The freeze on regional mechanisms has direct human consequences:

- **Record waiting list**: 62,234 households awaiting social housing, representing 10% of Brussels households
- **Persistent poor housing**: without renovation of the social stock, living conditions do not improve
- **Rental precariousness**: without regulatory adaptation, private-sector tenants remain exposed to rent increases
- **Shrinking supply**: the disengagement of private investors is reducing available supply
- **Struggling neighbourhoods**: without urban renovation contracts, the deterioration of certain neighbourhoods continues

## Outlook

Housing is the area where Brussels' political crisis has the most direct human consequences. Each month without new construction programmes means additional years of waiting for households on the social housing waiting list.

The next regional government will need to make housing an absolute priority: relaunching social construction, renovating the existing stock, adapting rent regulation and responding to the urgency of poor housing conditions in Brussels.
