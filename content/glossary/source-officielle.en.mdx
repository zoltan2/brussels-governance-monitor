The "official source" label is the highest confidence level used by the Brussels Governance Monitor to qualify its information. It is assigned when a piece of data or a fact comes directly from a verifiable institutional source: a published parliamentary document, an official government communication, a Court of Audit report, a publication in the Belgian Official Gazette or statistical data from a recognised public body.

This classification system addresses a fundamental transparency issue for the BGM. During a political crisis, rumours, interpretations and speculation multiply. By clearly distinguishing information supported by official sources from that based on a BGM estimate or analysis, the project enables its readers to assess the reliability of each piece of information for themselves.

The official sources used by the BGM include notably publications of the Brussels Parliament, Court of Audit reports, ordinances and decrees published in the Belgian Official Gazette, communications from be.brussels and data from bodies such as Actiris, the STIB or Bruxelles Logement.
