## Coalition Agreement: Announced Decisions
The agreement of 12 February 2026 marks a historic shift for Brussels public transport:

- **Metro 3 frozen for 10 years** -- the project as conceived (extension to Bordet, EUR 4.6 billion) is abandoned in favour of a **tram completing the loop** of the existing network
- **Good Move replaced** by a new Regional Mobility Plan, with smaller zones (school areas)
- **Tram 15** (Gare du Nord -- Tour & Taxis): maintained
- **Constitution and Palais du Midi construction sites**: continued
- **LEZ**: maintained -- **annual pass at EUR 350** (reduced rate EUR 200), fine per violation reduced from 350 to **EUR 80**, 4-fine annual cap removed
- **STIB fares**: preferential youth/senior rates maintained
- **Contested bollards**: removal
- **2nd car-free Sunday** per year

The freeze on Metro 3 is the most structuring decision for the sector: it redirects billions of euros of investment towards the tramway and changes the mobility strategy for 10+ years.

## Court of Audit and STIB (February 2026)

### Metro 3: the report that sealed the project's fate

The **Court of Audit** (Cour des comptes) published a devastating report on Metro 3, putting the total cost at **EUR 4.76 billion** -- a **+477%** overrun compared to initial estimates of less than EUR 1 billion. The report highlights a 15-year delay and concludes that the financial sustainability of the project is "seriously compromised".

It was this report that led the negotiators to abandon the project in favour of a **tram along the route originally planned** for the metro.

### STIB: postponed investments

According to the details of the agreement published by DH (13 February 2026), STIB will need to achieve structural savings. Several technical investments are being postponed:

- **Fleet replacement** tram/metro: plan revised downward
- **Metro signalling modernisation**: studies postponed
- **Bus equipment orders**: rescheduled

However, **operational resources** (day-to-day operations) are maintained at the current level.

## Inherited situation and contextual data

## A lifeline for Brussels mobility

The Brussels public transport network, managed by **STIB-MIVB**, forms the backbone of mobility in the Brussels-Capital Region. With approximately **430 million journeys per year**, 4 metro lines, 18 tram lines and 54 bus lines, STIB carries hundreds of thousands of Brussels residents, commuters and visitors daily.

The operation and development of this network depend on regional political decisions: the **multi-year investment plan**, **budgetary arbitrations** on major infrastructure projects, **fare policy** and the **planning** of new lines.

Between 9 June 2024 and 14 February 2026, these levers were frozen. The network operated, but it could no longer evolve.

## Metro 3: a project that advances, decisions that wait

### The state of play

The **Metro 3** project is the largest transport infrastructure construction project in Brussels history. It provides for the construction of a new metro line linking Gare du Nord to Bordet (Evere), with seven new stations. The total cost is estimated at approximately **EUR 3.2 billion**, co-financed by the Brussels-Capital Region and the federal government through **Beliris**.

Civil engineering works continue in accordance with contracts committed before June 2024. The tunnel boring machines advance, stations are being excavated, and workers are on site.

### What is blocked (regional level)

However, key political decisions remained suspended:

- **Budgetary arbitrations**: cost overruns could not be the subject of political decisions
- **Timeline**: any adjustments to the commissioning date could not be validated
- **Southern extension**: any decision on extending the line to southern Brussels was deferred
- **Intermodal integration**: decisions on connecting Metro 3 with other networks (SNCB, TEC, De Lijn) required political arbitration

### What continues (federal level)

**Beliris**, the federal cooperation agreement that co-finances Metro 3, continued to operate independently of the regional crisis. Federal investment decisions, public contracts managed by Beliris and the technical monitoring of the construction site continued. The project therefore advanced on its federal component, but the regional governance component was frozen.

The risk was that of a construction site operating at **two speeds**: the federal component (Beliris) that decided and invested, and the regional component (STIB/Region) that could no longer arbitrate the strategic choices within its remit.

## STIB investment plan: the strategic freeze

### The mechanism

STIB operates on the basis of a **management contract** with the Brussels-Capital Region, which defines public service obligations, quality targets and financial resources. This contract is accompanied by a **multi-year investment plan** that programmes the purchase of new rolling stock, station renovation, network extension and infrastructure modernisation.

### What is suspended

The multi-year investment plan could not be renewed or adapted. The consequences were gradual:

- **No ordering of new rolling stock** beyond existing contracts
- **No renovation** of ageing stations outside of already-launched projects
- **No investment** in the digital modernisation of the network (ticketing, real-time passenger information)
- **No adaptation** of services to Brussels' demographic changes

Rolling stock aged, stations deteriorated, and needs grew with the increasing Brussels population.

## New lines and frequencies: a frozen offering

### The need

Several rapidly expanding neighbourhoods (Heysel, Tour & Taxis, renovated European quarter) require an adaptation of the public transport offering. Projects for new tram lines, bus route extensions and increased frequencies were under study before June 2024.

### What is blocked

- **No creation** of new bus or tram lines
- **No increase** in frequencies on saturated lines
- **No route changes** to serve new neighbourhoods
- **No decision** on dedicated tramway projects

Users in poorly served neighbourhoods continued to endure long journey times and multiple connections.

## Fares and accessibility

Decisions on STIB network fares were also frozen:

- **No changes** to social fares for vulnerable populations
- **No extension** of free travel to new user categories
- **No fare harmonisation** with other operators (TEC, De Lijn, SNCB)
- **No additional investment** in accessibility for persons with reduced mobility (PRM)

## What continues to function

### Ongoing operations

STIB continues to transport hundreds of thousands of passengers daily. Timetables are maintained, lines operate, and staff are in place. Existing service quality is preserved.

### Ongoing construction

All projects launched before June 2024 continue normally. Metro 3 advances, planned station renovations are being carried out, and ordered rolling stock is being delivered.

### Maintenance

Network maintenance (tracks, stations, rolling stock) continues to be carried out within existing budgets.

## Impact on users

The freeze on decision-making had tangible consequences for users:

- **Saturation** of lines during peak hours with no prospect of short-term improvement
- **Ageing** of rolling stock on certain lines
- **Lack of adequate service** in newly developing neighbourhoods
- **Stagnation** of social fare options despite rising cost of living

## Outlook

Brussels public transport faced a paradox: a mega-project (Metro 3) that advanced mechanically, but an overall system that could not adapt to the changing needs of the city. Each month without political decisions widened the gap between the transport offering and user demand.

The Metro 3 question perfectly illustrated this tension: the tunnel boring machines dug, but the decisions that determined service quality, intermodality and the final cost of the project awaited a fully empowered government.
