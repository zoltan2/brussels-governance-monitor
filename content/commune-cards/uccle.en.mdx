## The largest municipality by area

Uccle is the largest municipality in the Brussels Region by area (22.9 km²) and the fifth by population (nearly 87,000 inhabitants). A residential and green municipality, it is governed by a renewed MR-DéFI + Ecolo-Groen coalition.

## Transparency: 5 out of 6 criteria

Uccle achieves a very good score. The **budget** and council **minutes** (with dedicated archives) are published online, the council is broadcast via **livestream** on YouTube, the **mandate registry** is accessible, and the municipality runs a **participatory budget** of EUR 150,000 via the MonOpinion platform. Only the **Open Data** portal is missing.

## Citizen participation: MonOpinion

Uccle uses the **MonOpinion** platform (based on Decidim) for its participatory budget of **EUR 150,000**, allowing citizens to propose and vote on improvement projects for the municipality.
