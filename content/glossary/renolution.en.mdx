Renolution was the flagship programme of the Brussels-Capital Region for the energy renovation of buildings. Launched in 2022, it merged the former energy grants and renovation grants into a single desk, with the aim of accelerating the energy transition of Brussels' building stock.

The government agreement of February 2026 announces the abolition of Renolution in its current form. The programme will be replaced by zero-interest loans (an envelope of EUR 200 million) for renovation. This decision is part of the overall budgetary effort to restore fiscal balance by 2029.
