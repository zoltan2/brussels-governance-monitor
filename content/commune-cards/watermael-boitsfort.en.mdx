## Brussels' greenest municipality

Watermael-Boitsfort is a residential municipality of 25,000 inhabitants, known for its green spaces (Sonian Forest) and garden cities. After 12 years of Ecolo mayoralty, David Leisterh (MR) takes over with an MR-Les Engagés + Ecolo-Groen coalition.

## Transparency: 5 out of 6 criteria

The **budget** and council **minutes** are published online, the council is broadcast via **livestream** (dedicated page with replays), the **mandate registry** is accessible, and a **participation service** manages neighbourhood meetings and participatory budgets. No dedicated **Open Data** portal.

## Political transition

David Leisterh's arrival as mayor marks the end of the Ecolo era in Watermael-Boitsfort. Ecolo nevertheless retains the CPAS presidency and two aldermanic positions in the new majority.
