## Key data

In 2024, Belgium had **253,866 disability allowance recipients** (income replacement allowance and/or integration allowance), representing **2.7%** of the population aged 18 and over. The Brussels-Capital Region accounts for **9.1%** of this total, approximately **23,100 people**.

The number of recipients continues to rise: **+4.7%** compared to 2023 (242,454). Among them, **52.4%** are women and **47.3%** are aged 55 or over. The average monthly allowance amounts to **934 EUR** (current prices, 2024).

In 2024, 163,337 applications were registered by the Directorate General for Persons with Disabilities (DG HAN), an increase of **17.2%** compared to 2021.

Iriscare's Centre for Autonomy and Disability Assessment (CEAH) processed **9,406 new applications** in 2025. Iriscare sent **14,490 European Disability Cards** to Brussels residents (6,320 in 2024, 5,871 in 2025).

## Coverage in the DPR

The Regional Policy Declaration (DPR) of 13 February 2026 mentions **handistreaming** only once, in the cross-cutting chapter. Key findings:

- **No dedicated section** on disability or accessibility
- **No specific budget**, no quantified target, no timeline
- **Phare** (COCOF Service) is not mentioned
- **Transport accessibility** is not addressed from a disability perspective
- The **European Disability Card** (mandatory 2028) does not appear
- The **European Accessibility Act** (in force since June 2025) is not mentioned

This contrasts with the **handistreaming ordinance** of 8 December 2016, which requires the Brussels-Capital Region to systematically incorporate disability into all regional policies, including public procurement and subsidies. The government is required to submit an interim report and an end-of-legislature report to Parliament.

## Transport accessibility

### Metro network

Of the **69 stations** in the Brussels underground network:

| Status | Number |
|--------|--------|
| **Equipped with lifts** | **55** |
| Being equipped | 5 |
| In preparation | 3 |
| Under study | 6 |

### Buses and trams

- **100%** of the bus fleet is equipped with access ramps
- **55%** of trams and buses have external audio announcements (mid-2022)
- The new TNG trams include manual ramps as standard
- M7 metro trains (2021) feature passive platform gap-filling systems at doors

### Surface stops

STIB has over **2,000 surface stops**. The Strategic Accessibility Plan (PSMA) provides for the improvement of **50 stops per year**. Priority targets stops near hospitals, shopping centres, schools and high-traffic locations.

### Digital tools

- **AccessiBus** (2021): real-time bus network accessibility verification
- **AccessiTram** (30 April 2024): same tool extended to the tram network
- The STIB website holds the **AnySurfer** accessibility certification

## Employment and disability

### Sheltered workshops (ETA)

Brussels has **12 sheltered workshops (ETA)**, all constituted as non-profit organisations and accredited by the Service Phare (COCOF). They employ approximately **1,450 workers with disabilities** in **60 different trades**, supervised by some 370 able-bodied workers (supervisors and support staff).

Sectors covered:
- **Packaging and manufacturing** (6 ETA): APAM, APRE, Brochage Renaître, Groupe Foes, Travco, Travie
- **Green spaces and environment** (3 ETA): La Ferme Nos Pilifs, Les Jeunes Jardiniers, La Serre-Outil
- **Office work and printing** (3 ETA): Citeco, Manufast, L'Ouvroir

### Open labour market employment

The federal quota requires **3%** of workers with disabilities in the civil service. Actiris offers specialised support through **DiversiCom** for integration into the open labour market. The ESF+ (European Social Fund Plus) targets inactive persons with disabilities, whose inactivity rate reaches **30%** in Brussels.

### Discrimination

UNIA registered **1,267 reports** related to disability in 2024 at national level, resulting in **582 cases** — the highest figure in five years. Disability accounts for **28%** of all UNIA cases, just behind racism. **35%** of disability cases concern employment discrimination.

In Brussels specifically, UNIA handled nearly **1,300 reports** across all criteria, opening **487 discrimination cases** in 2024.

## Individual aids and mobility

### Mobility aids (Iriscare)

Since 1 January 2024, mobility aid coverage has been expanded: Brussels health insurers can now contribute towards the purchase, rental, as well as **maintenance, repairs, power-assist devices and environmental control systems**.

In 2024, mobility aid expenditure amounted to **5.86 million EUR** for **40,234 services**:

| Type of aid | Expenditure | Services |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Manual wheelchairs | 957,451 EUR | 775 |
| Electric wheelchairs | 711,372 EUR | 95 |
| Walkers | 484,103 EUR | 3,370 |
| Scooters | 258,178 EUR | 84 |
| Nursing home rentals | 2,080,000 EUR | 32,272 |
| Anti-decubitus cushions | 280,899 EUR | 799 |
| Adaptations | 924,430 EUR | 2,583 |

### Service Phare (COCOF)

Service Phare, an administrative directorate of COCOF, accredits and subsidises Brussels-based facilities for persons with disabilities: day centres, adapted collective housing, support services, sheltered workshops. It also manages the **personal assistance budget (BAP)**.

Since 2024, the management of individual technical aid grants has been transferred to Iriscare (COCOM / Joint Community Commission), which delegates it to health insurers.

The Service Phare website has been closed and redirected to **ccf.brussels** (COCOF) and **handicap.brussels** (information portal).

## European framework

Several European instruments apply directly to Brussels:

- **European Accessibility Act** (Directive 2019/882): in force since 28 June 2025. Requires the accessibility of digital products and services (ATMs, payment terminals, e-commerce, banking services). Fines of up to 200,000 EUR per infringement in Belgium.

- **European Disability Card** (Directives 2024/2841 and 2024/2842): mandatory across all 27 Member States by **28 June 2028**. Belgium is one of 7 pilot countries. Iriscare has been issuing the card to Brussels residents since 2024 (14,490 cards sent).

- **UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD)**: Belgium was reviewed in September 2024. The Committee issued criticisms regarding accessibility, employment and deinstitutionalisation.

- **PRM transport regulations**: rail passenger rights (2021/782), air passenger rights (1107/2006) and bus/coach passenger rights (181/2011) — all applicable in Brussels.

- **ESF+**: Actiris is the managing authority for Brussels. The fund specifically targets inactive persons with disabilities.

## Distribution of competences

| Level | Competences | Actor |
|--------|------------|--------|
| EU | EAA, European Disability Card, PRM transport regulations, ESF+, UNCRPD | European Commission |
| Federal | Allowances (ARR, AI), DG HAN recognition, parking card, INAMI, 3% quota | FPS Social Security |
| Brussels Region | Handistreaming (2016 ordinance), roads, STIB, adapted housing (SLRB), employment (Actiris) | Brussels Mobility, Actiris |
| COCOM / Iriscare | Mobility aids, CEAH, European Card, bi-communal coordination | Iriscare |
| COCOF / Phare | Sheltered workshops, day centres, collective housing, BAP, support services | Service Phare |
| VGC | Personal assistance (Dutch-speaking side), referral to VAPH | VGC |
| 19 Municipalities | Municipal building accessibility, local roads, PRM parking, inclusion plans | 19 municipalities |

## Issues to monitor

- **European Accessibility Act**: no compliance monitoring mechanism has been identified in Belgium at this stage
- **European Disability Card**: transition from 7 pilot countries to 27 mandatory Member States by June 2028
- **COCOF DPR**: the text, presented on 24 February 2026, may contain specific commitments on Phare and disability
- **STIB 100% accessible**: no public timeline for the remaining 14 stations (5 being equipped + 3 in preparation + 6 under study)
- **Handistreaming**: the 2019-2024 end-of-legislature report has not been made public; the new legislature must clarify its commitments
- **UNIA**: upward trend in disability reports (+28% of all cases in 2024)

## What the data does not show

Certain dimensions of disability in Brussels lack structured public data:

- **Unified regional PRM register**: there is no consolidated register of the total number of persons with disabilities in Brussels. FPS figures (allowances) and Iriscare figures (assessments) cover different scopes and cannot be added together.
- **Private building accessibility**: no public data on the compliance of housing, shops or offices with accessibility standards.
- **EAA compliance**: the European Accessibility Act has been in force since June 2025, but no assessment of the compliance of Brussels digital services is available.
- **Phare/COCOF budget**: the Service Phare budget is not published as open data. Estimating the overall disability funding in Brussels is impossible without this figure.
- **Daily PRM experience**: there is no barometer measuring the lived experience of persons with disabilities in transport, public spaces or Brussels services.
