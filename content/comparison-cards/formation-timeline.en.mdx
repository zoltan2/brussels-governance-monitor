## Context

The elections of 9 June 2024 simultaneously renewed the regional parliaments and the federal parliament. Each Region began its own government formation process, with very different outcomes.

## Flanders: rapid formation (~4 months)

The Flemish Parliament quickly identified a majority. The designated formateur was able to constitute a government that was sworn in during October 2024. This speed is explained by a more legible parliamentary configuration, with fewer parties needed to reach a majority.

**Consequences:**
- Continuity of regional policies
- 2025 budget voted within constitutional deadlines
- No interruption in public investments

## Wallonia: intermediate formation (~8 months)

The Walloon Region experienced a longer formation process. Negotiations lasted from the summer of 2024 to January 2025, and the Walloon government was sworn in during February 2025. The Region operated on provisional twelfths during this period.

**Consequences:**
- Provisional twelfths for approximately eight months
- Delay in launching new regional programmes
- 2025 budget ultimately voted in December 2025

## Brussels: formation still ongoing (20+ months)

The Brussels-Capital Region still has no fully empowered government as of February 2026. Several formation attempts have failed, with successive information and formation missions. The outgoing government remains in caretaker mode.

**Consequences:**
- Uninterrupted provisional twelfths regime since the elections
- Paralysis of all new regional policy
- Erosion of public action capacity

## Explanatory factors

The length of the Brussels formation is explained by several structural factors:

- **Linguistic balances**: the special law requires representation of both language groups in the regional government
- **Political fragmentation**: the high number of parties in the Brussels Parliament makes coalitions arithmetically and politically complex
- **Community issues**: some parties set conditions linked to institutional reform, without direct connection to regional competences
