## Ambitious targets, uncertain trajectory

The Brussels-Capital Region has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by **40% by 2030** compared to 2005, within the framework of the Air-Climate-Energy Plan (PACE). This target, aligned with European commitments, requires massive investment in building renovation, sustainable mobility and the energy transition.

Since June 2024, the regional government has been in caretaker mode. No new structural political decisions can be taken. The PACE continues on its existing trajectory for programmes already approved, but new phases are frozen.

## Renolution grants under pressure

### The scheme

Renolution is the one-stop shop for renovation and energy grants in the Brussels Region. It brings together the former energy, renovation and facade improvement grants. The scheme aims to accelerate the renovation of the Brussels building stock, of which **more than 70% of residential buildings date from before 1970**.

### What is blocked

In caretaker mode, existing grants continue to be processed within the limits of the approved budget. However:

- **No increase** in grant amounts despite inflation
- **No new programmes** targeting the most critical energy-inefficient buildings
- **Reduced available funding**: provisional twelfths do not allow for increased allocations
- **Longer waiting times**: processing delays have increased due to lack of additional administrative staff

The construction sector, which depends heavily on these grants for residential renovation, reports a slowdown in energy renovation projects.

## The Air-Climate-Energy Plan (PACE) at a standstill

### Achievements

The PACE adopted in 2016 and strengthened in 2019 enabled:

- The implementation of the EPB (Energy Performance of Buildings) certificate system
- The development of the district heating network
- The progressive extension of the Low Emission Zone (LEZ)
- Support for insulation of public buildings

### What requires a full government

- **New phases of the PACE**: the evaluation and revision of the plan for the 2025-2030 period requires a government decision
- **Binding sectoral targets**: the distribution of effort between buildings, transport and industry has not been updated
- **Transition financing**: multi-year funding envelopes cannot be committed under provisional twelfths
- **Coordination with the federal level**: the National Energy-Climate Plan (NECP) requires updated regional contributions

## Air quality: fragile progress

Air quality in Brussels has improved in recent years, notably thanks to the Low Emission Zone (LEZ) and the renewal of the vehicle fleet. According to IRCELINE data, the annual average NO2 level dropped below **26 µg/m3** in 2025, compared to more than 30 µg/m3 in 2019.

However, this progress relies on mechanisms already in place. Without new decisions:

- The **LEZ timetable** (ban on Euro 5 diesel vehicles planned for 2030) cannot be accelerated or adapted
- **Investment in public electric vehicle charging points** is stagnating
- The **conversion of STIB bus fleets** to electric depends on new budget decisions

## What continues to function

- **Brussels Environment**: emissions monitoring, air quality monitoring, environmental permits
- **LEZ**: the Low Emission Zone continues to apply according to the approved timetable
- **Renolution grants**: processing of applications within existing budget limits
- **IRCELINE monitoring network**: monitoring stations continue to operate

## Why this matters

Climate is the domain where lost time is most costly. Each year of delay in building renovation, energy transition and adaptation to urban heatwaves widens the gap between commitments made and the actual trajectory. Brussels, as one of the densest regions in Europe, is particularly vulnerable to heat islands and air pollution. Existing programmes maintain a minimum baseline, but without new political impetus, the 2030 target moves further away each month.
