## What happened

In mid-September 2024, the formateur launched a series of bilateral consultations with each of the parties represented in the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region. Each delegation was received individually to set out its priorities, conditions for participating in a government and red lines.

## The proceedings

The consultations spanned several weeks. The formateur successively received delegations from all parties, including those not earmarked for the Arizona coalition, in order to gain a complete picture of the Brussels political landscape.

The topics covered during these consultations included:
- Each party's programmatic priorities
- Conditions for government participation
- The question of linguistic balances
- The desired budgetary framework

## The early signals

These consultations already revealed tensions. Several Dutch-speaking parties expressed reservations about the Arizona formula as transposed from the federal level. French-speaking parties not included in the formula voiced their opposition to being sidelined. The picture was emerging: the formation process would not be straightforward.
