## Context

The regional and federal elections of 9 June 2024 opened a period of government formation in all three Regions. The speed of formation directly determined each Region's ability to adopt a full budget.

## Brussels-Capital: the budget deadlock

The Brussels-Capital Region still has no fully empowered government as of February 2026. The outgoing government manages current affairs, and the Brussels Parliament has been voting quarterly provisional appropriation ordinances (provisional twelfths) since July 2024.

**Concrete consequences:**
- No new investment can be launched
- Subsidies and multi-year agreements reaching expiry cannot be renewed
- Cumulative inflation (~6% over two years) erodes the real value of expenditure

## Flanders: swift return to budget normality

The Flemish government was formed in October 2024, approximately four months after the elections. The Flemish Parliament voted the 2025 budget within the usual timeframe, allowing investments and regional policies to continue without significant interruption.

## Wallonia: delayed recovery

The Walloon Region experienced a longer formation than Flanders, with a regional government installed in February 2025, approximately eight months after the elections. The Region operated on provisional twelfths for nearly a year but was able to vote its 2025 budget in December 2025, ending the provisional regime.

## What the comparison reveals

The divergence between the three Regions illustrates a phenomenon specific to Brussels: institutional complexity (linguistic balances, number of parties needed to form a majority) considerably lengthens the formation process. While Flanders and Wallonia have returned to normal budget operations, Brussels remains in an exceptional regime that limits its capacity to act.
