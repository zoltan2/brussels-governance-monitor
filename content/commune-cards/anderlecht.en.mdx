## A large working-class municipality in digital transition

Anderlecht is the third most populated municipality in the Brussels Region, with over 123,000 inhabitants. Historically working-class and multicultural, it faces significant challenges in housing, employment, and social cohesion.

## Transparency: 4 out of 6 criteria

Anderlecht meets four of the six BGM monitoring criteria. The **budget** is published online, municipal council **minutes** are accessible, the **mandate registry** is available, and the municipality has a **citizen participation** platform (Decidim). However, it does not have its own **Open Data** portal, and the council **livestream** is classified as "partial" due to debates over its continuation.

## Citizen participation: Decidim

Anderlecht uses the **Decidim** platform (participez.anderlecht.be) to allow citizens to propose and debate municipal projects. Participatory budgets by neighbourhood are organised regularly.

## The livestream question

Anderlecht's municipal council introduced a livestream of its sessions, but this has been subject to debate regarding its continuation. Some elected officials have questioned the cost and usefulness of the system. BGM classifies this indicator as "partial" as long as the livestream is not guaranteed as a permanent practice.

## CPAS under pressure

Anderlecht's CPAS (Public Centre for Social Welfare) faces growing pressure, with approximately 6,000 recipients of the social integration income (RIS). The CPAS budgetary situation is a major issue in municipal policy.
