## Coalition Agreement: Announced Commitments
The agreement of 12 February 2026 profoundly transforms environmental mechanisms:

- **Renolution replaced** by **zero-interest loans** (EUR 200 million envelope until 2029) -- the ~15,000 pending applications will need to be processed under this new regime
- **LEZ maintained**: the schedule for future phases is unchanged
- **Brownfield sites**: Wiels, Ajvil, Donderberg **preserved**; 18-month moratorium on Keyenbempt, Calevoet, Josaphat, Meylemeersch
- **Vivaqua-Hydria merger**: water management consolidated into a single operator, recapitalisation of **EUR 180 million** (Region at 49.99%)
- **EUR 30 million** for the water merger transition

**Open question**: the shift from grants (Renolution) to zero-interest loans fundamentally changes the incentive for energy renovation. Low-income households, who cannot borrow even at zero interest, risk being excluded from the scheme. The impact on the ~75% of poorly insulated buildings remains to be assessed.

The following sections document the inherited situation and contextual data.

## A sector at the heart of Brussels' challenges

Environment and climate are central challenges for the Brussels-Capital Region. With high urban density, an ageing building stock and European climate targets to meet, Brussels faces major environmental challenges: energy renovation of buildings, air quality, water management and biodiversity conservation.

Regional environmental policy relies on several key mechanisms: **Renolution premiums**, the **Blue Deal** for water management, the **air quality action plan** and the **Nature Plan** for biodiversity. These programmes are primarily led by Brussels Environment and its partners.

Between 9 June 2024 and 14 February 2026, the caretaker regional government could no longer take new structural decisions in these areas.

## Renolution premiums: energy renovation stalls

### The mechanism

The Renolution programme is the Region's primary lever for encouraging the energy renovation of buildings. It offers premiums for roof and facade insulation, replacement of oil boilers, installation of solar panels and heat pumps. This programme is essential for meeting regional climate targets.

### What is blocked

Under the caretaker government, the Renolution programme could no longer accept new applications. Files submitted before June 2024 continued to be processed, but:

- **No new premium applications** are accepted
- **No adjustment** of premium amounts for construction cost inflation
- **No expansion** of the programme to new types of work
- **No simplification** of administrative procedures promised by the Region

With approximately **75% of Brussels buildings** rated EPC D or lower, the need for energy renovation remains massive.

## Blue Deal: water management suspended

### The stakes

Brussels faces a dual water challenge: increasingly frequent flooding episodes during heavy rainfall, and the need for sustainable water resource management in the context of climate change. The Blue Deal, an interregional water management plan, provided for investments in stormwater infrastructure, surface de-sealing and protection of flood-prone areas.

### What is frozen

- **No new projects** for surface de-sealing or storm basins
- **No funding** for new stormwater management infrastructure
- **No update** to the mapping of flood risk zones
- **No new partnerships** with municipalities for local water management

## Air quality: measures on hold

### The context

Air quality in Brussels remains a major public health issue. The low-emission zone (LEZ), established in 2018, progressively restricts access for the most polluting vehicles. The regional air quality action plan provided for a gradual tightening of standards and complementary measures.

### What is suspended

- The **tightening schedule** for the low-emission zone could not be accelerated or modified
- **New measures** to reduce air pollution could not be adopted
- The **enhanced monitoring plan** planned for 2025-2026 could not be launched
- **Subsidies to individuals** for replacing polluting vehicles were frozen

## Biodiversity: the green network on pause

The Nature Plan of the Brussels Region aimed to strengthen urban biodiversity and develop the green network (ecological corridors, neighbourhood green spaces, green roofs). Under the caretaker government:

- **New projects** for creating green spaces are suspended
- **Neighbourhood contracts** incorporating a biodiversity component could not be launched
- The **management plan** for Brussels' Natura 2000 areas could not be updated
- **Subsidies** for citizen greening projects were frozen

## What continues to function

### Environmental permits

Environmental permits already issued remain valid. Renewal applications and routine administrative procedures continue to be processed by Brussels Environment.

### Environmental monitoring

Brussels Environment continues its monitoring missions: air quality measurement stations, watercourse monitoring, management of regional green spaces and forests (Sonian Forest, regional parks).

### Low-emission zone

The LEZ continues to operate according to the schedule established before June 2024. Controls and sanctions remain in force.

## Impact on the ground

The freeze on environmental mechanisms had direct and measurable consequences:

- **Delayed climate targets**: the CO2 reduction commitments for 2030 are becoming difficult to achieve
- **Slowed energy renovation**: property owners could no longer access Renolution premiums for new projects
- **Flood risks**: without new investments in water management, Brussels' vulnerability to heavy rainfall increases
- **Public health**: the delay in strengthening air quality measures directly affects residents' health

## Outlook

Environmental policy is a domain where lost time is difficult to make up. Each year without an active energy renovation programme increased the Region's climate debt. The European Green Deal targets were not suspended by Brussels' political crisis.

The new regional government will need not only to relaunch the frozen programmes, but also to compensate for the accumulated delay to meet Belgium's climate commitments.
