## The smallest municipality after Saint-Josse

Koekelberg is one of Brussels' smallest municipalities (1.18 km²) with 22,600 inhabitants. Ahmed Laaouej (PS) led the list to over 50% of votes but renounced the mayoralty to keep his regional deputy seat (anti-cumul rules). Olivia P'Tito was designated as mayor.

## Transparency: 4 out of 6 criteria

The **budget** and council **minutes** (via the DOCODIS system) are published online, the **mandate registry** is accessible, and the municipality organises a **participatory budget** (max EUR 20,000/initiative). However, no confirmed council **livestream** and no **Open Data** portal.

## Participatory budget via neighbourhood contract

Koekelberg organises a participatory budget within the Jacquet neighbourhood contract framework, with a ceiling of **EUR 20,000 per initiative**. A citizen assembly for climate was also organised.
