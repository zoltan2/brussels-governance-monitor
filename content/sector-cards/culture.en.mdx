## Coalition Agreement: Announced Commitments
According to concordant press sources, the agreement of 12 February 2026 announces measures for the cultural sector:

- **Kanal saved**: **EUR 60 million** for the opening of the contemporary art museum (former Citroen garage). The annual operating budget will be degressive, with a requirement to seek own revenue
- **Review of discretionary subsidies**: all regional subsidy envelopes will be re-examined as part of the EUR 1.2 billion fiscal consolidation effort

**Point of attention**: the rescue of Kanal (EUR 60M) is a major investment, but the systematic review of discretionary subsidies could affect other regional cultural institutions. The details of the overall cultural arbitration are not yet known.

## Converging budgetary pressures (February 2026)

The Brussels cultural sector faces simultaneous cuts at **three levels of government**:

### Federation Wallonia-Brussels

The FWB 2026 budget, adopted in late February, provides for **EUR 255 million in total savings**, including **EUR 12.9 million** in cuts to the cultural sector (approximately 4% of a cultural budget of EUR 320M+). Concrete measures:

- **Non-indexation** of cultural subsidies in 2026
- **Moratorium on new recognitions** and accreditations until 2028 (cultural centres, public libraries, arts, continuing education)
- Cumulative FWB savings reach **EUR 500 million over 4 years** (2026-2029)

### City of Brussels

The City of Brussels reduced its cultural budget by **15 to 20%** between 2024 and 2026. Concrete consequences:

- **La Centrale** (contemporary art centre): **closed** in February 2026
- **FAME Festival**: funding cancelled
- Reduction in subsidies to the Theatre Royal du Parc and the KVS

### Alarm from the sector

**RAB/BKO** (Brussels Arts Network, 168 cultural actors) launched a public appeal for **financial guarantees** for 2026, denouncing an "unbearable uncertainty". Organisations have laid off staff, imposed part-time work or ceased their activities.

The **Zinneke Parade 2026**, an emblematic Brussels event, has no confirmed regional structural funding.
