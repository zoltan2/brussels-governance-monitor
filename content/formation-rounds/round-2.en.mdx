## Context

Following the failure of the first formateur, the Brussels Parliament opts for an information phase. A duo of informateurs is designated, comprising a figure from Les Engages and a figure from Groen, to ensure bilingual representation from the outset.

## The mission

The informateurs receive a broad mandate: to explore all possible coalition configurations, without being limited to the Arizona formula that failed. Their objective is to submit a report with a clear recommendation to Parliament.

## Proceedings

The duo conducts systematic consultations with all parties represented in the Brussels Parliament. Each party is invited to present its priorities and red lines. The informateurs explore in particular configurations that include the ecologists (Ecolo and Groen) and the socialists (PS and Vooruit), parties that had been excluded from the Arizona formula.

Several avenues emerge:
- A broad progressive coalition including PS, Ecolo, Groen, Les Engages, Vooruit and one.brussels
- A variant without one.brussels but with external support
- A so-called Brussels "rainbow" formula

## Recommendation

On 30 May 2025, the informateurs submit their report to the president of Parliament. They recommend entrusting the formation to a new formateur with a mandate centred on the broad progressive coalition, identified as the only formula with the potential for a majority in both linguistic groups.

This round concludes on a positive note: unlike the first, it produces a concrete recommendation that opens the way to the next phase.
