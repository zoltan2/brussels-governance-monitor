The Regional Policy Declaration (DPR) is the reference document that translates the government agreement into concrete commitments for the legislative term. Presented by the Minister-President before the Brussels Parliament, it covers all regional competences: budget, mobility, housing, employment, environment, security, etc.

The DPR of 13 February 2026 is the first after 613 days of caretaker government. It structures the commitments of the 7-party government around thematic chapters. Brussels Governance Monitor tracks the implementation of each quantified commitment in this DPR.
