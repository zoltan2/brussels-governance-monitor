## A new mayor through anti-cumul rules

Evere has 46,000 inhabitants and is led by Alessandro Zappala (PS), designated as mayor after Ridouane Chahid renounced the mayoralty to keep his federal deputy mandate (anti-cumul rules). The PS-MR coalition has a large majority (28/35 seats).

## Transparency: 3 out of 6 criteria

The **budget** and council **minutes** (dedicated page organised by year, 2015-2025) are published online, and the **mandate registry** is accessible via the transparency section. However, no confirmed **livestream**, no **citizen participation platform**, and no **Open Data** portal.

## Room for improvement

Evere has significant room for improvement in digital transparency. The absence of livestream and participatory budget places it below the average of Brussels municipalities.
