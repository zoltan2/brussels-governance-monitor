## Context

Building on the informateurs' recommendation, the Brussels Parliament designates a second formateur from the PS, the party with the largest number of seats among the parties of the recommended coalition. The mission begins on 1 June 2025.

## The formula attempted

The formateur works on the broad progressive coalition recommended by the informateurs: PS, Ecolo, Groen, Les Engages, Vooruit and one.brussels. This six-party configuration is unprecedented in Brussels and promises on paper a comfortable majority in both linguistic groups.

## Proceedings

The first weeks are encouraging: the parties agree on the broad outlines of a general policy statement covering housing and mobility. However, negotiations quickly stall on two crucial points:

1. **The distribution of ministerial portfolios** -- with six parties at the table, distributing the portfolios becomes a puzzle, with each claiming strategic responsibilities.
2. **The budgetary framework** -- after more than a year of provisional twelfths, the regional budget is under strain. The parties diverge on investment priorities and the acceptable level of debt.

## Stalemate

The summer period worsens the situation. Negotiations slow to a crawl in July and August 2025. The formateur is unable to present a budgetary note accepted by all partners. On 15 August 2025, he acknowledges the stalemate of his mission without formally resigning, hoping for a resumption after the summer break.

The Parliament nevertheless decides to change approach and calls on a mediator to try to break the deadlock.
