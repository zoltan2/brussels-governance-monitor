## What happened

In late January 2026, the citizen collective **respect.brussels** organised an unprecedented meeting: representatives of all 11 parties present in the Brussels Parliament agreed to sit around the same table, in a non-partisan framework organised by citizens.

## The respect.brussels collective

Born from citizen exasperation at the length of the crisis, respect.brussels brings together Brussels residents from all backgrounds. The collective does not advocate a political programme and does not support any party. Its sole objective: to secure the formation of a functioning regional government as soon as possible.

## The meeting

The meeting stood apart from classical political negotiations in several respects:

- **Citizen framework**: it was civil society that convened, not Parliament
- **Total inclusivity**: all 11 parties were present, including those in the opposition
- **Transparency**: the collective made public the commitments given by the parties
- **Concrete agenda**: focus on a formation timetable and minimum principles

## The significance

This initiative marked a turning point in the Brussels crisis. For the first time, it was the citizens -- not the institutions -- who created a space for political dialogue. The meeting did not produce a government agreement, but it generated a public commitment from the parties to intensify negotiations.
