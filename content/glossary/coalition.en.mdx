A coalition is an alliance of several political parties which, together, hold a majority in parliament and agree to form a government. In the Belgian proportional representation system, since no single party generally holds an absolute majority on its own, the formation of coalitions is the rule rather than the exception.

Forming a coalition in Brussels is particularly complex due to the Region's institutional structure. The Brussels government must include ministers from both linguistic groups, and certain decisions require a special majority within each group. This means the coalition must be viable not only in terms of total seats but also within each linguistic group.

The number of parties potentially involved, programmatic differences and linguistic balance requirements explain why coalition negotiations in Brussels can extend over many months, or even lead to a prolonged deadlock requiring several Rounds of negotiation.
