## Government agreement: announced impacts
According to concordant press sources, the agreement of 12 February 2026 contains several measures that affect the commercial sector:

- **New mobility plan** replacing Good Move: the revision of traffic layouts will affect commercial areas located in redesigned neighbourhood cells. The impact on shop accessibility will be a central issue
- **LEZ maintained with an annual pass** (EUR 350, social rate EUR 200): shopkeepers and their suppliers using non-compliant vehicles will benefit from a predictable cost instead of per-infraction fines
- **Renolution grants removed** in their current form: businesses that benefited from these grants for the energy renovation of their buildings lose this instrument
- **Personal income tax cut by 1%** and increase in the registration fee abatement ceiling (EUR 600,000 to EUR 800,000): these fiscal measures aim to strengthen the residential attractiveness of Brussels, which indirectly supports local commerce

**Point of attention**: the end of the caretaker period allows the relaunch of commercial revitalisation programmes, the night economy strategy and the modernisation of the regulatory framework. The budgetary effort will determine the scale of resources allocated to these relaunches.

The following sections document the inherited situation and contextual data.

## Local commerce, the vital fabric of Brussels

Commerce is an essential pillar of the Brussels economy and neighbourhood life. With approximately **60,000 commercial establishments** and **55,000 direct jobs** in retail, this sector runs through all 19 municipalities of the Region. From the major shopping streets (Rue Neuve, Avenue Louise, Chaussee d'Ixelles) to small neighbourhood shops, the Brussels commercial fabric is dense and diverse.

Regional commerce policy relies on several mechanisms: **revitalisation subsidies**, the **night economy strategy**, **commercial regulation** and the **regional commerce action plan**. These instruments are primarily managed by hub.brussels and Atrium Brussels.

Between 9 June 2024 and 14 February 2026, the caretaker regional government could no longer take new decisions in these areas.

## Commercial revitalisation: struggling neighbourhoods without support

### The mechanism

Commercial revitalisation programmes aim to combat the decline of Brussels' commercial centres. They fund the renovation of empty retail units, support for struggling shopkeepers, improvement of public spaces around commercial areas and collective promotion of shopping neighbourhoods.

### What is blocked

With a vacancy rate estimated at approximately **15%** in the Brussels Region, the need for revitalisation remained significant. Under the caretaker government:

- **No new calls for projects** for the renovation of empty retail units
- **No funding** for new shopkeeper support programmes
- **No partnership agreements** with municipalities for revitalisation projects
- **No support** for shopkeeper associations to develop collective strategies

Some Brussels neighbourhoods, particularly in low-income areas, saw their commercial situation deteriorate in the absence of regional support.

## Night economy: a strategy on hold

### The stakes

Brussels has a rich nightlife that contributes to its attractiveness and generates significant economic activity: restaurants, bars, concert venues, clubs. The Region had begun developing a specific strategy to support and regulate this night economy, balancing economic activity, residents' peace and security.

### The consequences

- **No adoption** of the night economy strategy
- **No adapted regulatory framework** for nighttime activities
- **No structural mediation** between nighttime operators and residents
- **No funding** for adapted nighttime safety and cleanliness programmes

## Commercial regulation: modernisation on hold

The regulatory framework for Brussels retail was due to be modernised to adapt to sector developments: the rise of e-commerce, new forms of commerce (pop-up stores, dark kitchens), adaptation of trading hours. Under the caretaker government:

- The **planned regulatory updates** could not be adopted
- The **administrative simplifications** promised to shopkeepers were postponed
- The **legal framework** for new forms of commerce remained unclear
- **Coordination** with the federal level on e-commerce issues stagnated

## Regional commerce action plan

The regional action plan coordinates all commerce support policies: shopkeeper training, digital support, promotion of Brussels artisans, commercial attractiveness. Under the caretaker government:

- **Renewal** of the expired plan was impossible
- **New support measures** could not be launched
- **Coordination** between different institutional actors was limited to routine tasks
- **Budgets** could not be reallocated to address sector emergencies

## What continues to function

### Commercial activity

Brussels shopkeepers continue their activities within the existing regulatory framework. The market functions normally, although the absence of an active support policy weakens the most vulnerable businesses.

### Existing permits

Commercial permits and authorisations issued before June 2024 remain fully valid. Renewal procedures within the framework of day-to-day management continue.

### Basic support

hub.brussels and Atrium Brussels continue to support shopkeepers and entrepreneurs with existing resources and programmes.

## Impact on the ground

The freeze on regional mechanisms had visible consequences in Brussels neighbourhoods:

- **Increasing vacancy**: without a revitalisation programme, struggling shopping streets deteriorate
- **Weakened neighbourhood commerce**: small independent shopkeepers lack support against online competition
- **Slowed digital transition**: shopkeepers wishing to digitalise lack guidance
- **Declining commercial attractiveness**: Brussels loses ground to better-supported peripheral commercial zones

## Outlook

Brussels commerce faces a structural transformation: the rise of e-commerce, evolving consumption habits, sustainability challenges. Without an active regional policy, this transformation is occurring at the expense of neighbourhood shops and the vitality of local areas.

The new regional government will need to relaunch commercial revitalisation programmes and adapt the regulatory framework to the sector's new realities, or risk increasing vacancy rates and deterioration of the local commercial fabric.
