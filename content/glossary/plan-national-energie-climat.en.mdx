The National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP; French: Plan National Energie-Climat, PNEC) is a planning instrument required by the European regulation on the governance of the Energy Union. Each EU member state must submit a plan detailing its objectives and measures for greenhouse gas emission reduction, renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy interconnection for the period 2021-2030.

In Belgium, the development of the NECP is particularly complex due to the country's federal structure. Competences in energy and climate are shared between the federal level and the three Regions. The contribution of the Brussels-Capital Region is essential, particularly for objectives related to buildings, urban transport and air quality.

The absence of a full Brussels government directly impacts the Region's ability to commit to ambitious targets and implement the necessary measures. European climate commitments do not wait for national political crises, and delays in the development and implementation of the NECP can expose Belgium to infringement proceedings by the European Commission.
