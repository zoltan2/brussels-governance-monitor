## The fourth most populated municipality

Molenbeek-Saint-Jean is the fourth most populated municipality in Brussels with nearly 100,000 inhabitants. An unprecedented **PS-PTB** coalition was formed with a slim majority of 23/45 seats. Mayor Catherine Moureaux is on extended leave.

## Transparency: 3 out of 6 criteria

The **budget** is published online (downloadable PDFs), the council is broadcast via **livestream** on YouTube ("I like Molenbeek" channel), and the **mandate registry** is accessible via the annual report. Council **minutes** are partially online, **citizen participation** is limited to occasional workshops ("A Vision for Molenbeek"), and there is no **Open Data** portal.

## PS-PTB coalition: a first in Molenbeek

The PS-PTB agreement is a first in Molenbeek and is being closely monitored for its impact on municipal policy. The MR, third force (17.1%), sits in opposition.
