Commuters (French: navetteurs) are workers who travel daily to Brussels from Flanders or Wallonia to work there without residing in the Region. It is estimated that approximately **360,000** incoming commuters enter Brussels daily, exceeding the number of Brussels residents who work there themselves.

This phenomenon is at the heart of the **Brussels fiscal paradox**: Brussels produces approximately 19% of Belgian GDP, but the personal income taxes (IPP) of commuters are collected by the municipalities of their place of residence, outside the Region. Brussels bears the infrastructure costs (roads, transport, security, sanitation) without receiving the corresponding tax revenues.

This imbalance partly explains why Brussels, despite its apparent economic wealth, has lower public revenue per capita than the other two Regions. The question of Brussels' financing and the fair distribution of costs related to commuters is a recurring issue in Belgian institutional negotiations.
