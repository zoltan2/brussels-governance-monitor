## What is blocked

### Metro 3 — North-South Line

The Metro 3 project aims to create a new metro line connecting the north of Brussels (Bordet) to the south (Albert). The first construction phases (converting existing pre-metro to full metro between Albert and Gare du Nord) are underway as they were already approved.

However, a **special commission of the Brussels Parliament** (end of 2025) revealed a **255% budget overrun** compared to the initial budget, with the delivery horizon pushed back to **2034 at the earliest**. The extension to Bordet (the most ambitious part) requires new political decisions:

- Budget reassessment and financial sustainability review
- Approval of the definitive route north of Schaerbeek
- Coordination with Master Development Plans (PAD)

Without a full government, these decisions cannot be taken.

### Road tunnels -- the Loi-Belliard case

Brussels has more than 30 road tunnels, several of which require major renovation. The most emblematic case is the **Loi-Belliard tunnel**: planning permits have been obtained, the budget of **161 million EUR** has been identified, but the works cannot begin without a full government to commit the expenditure.

The Stephanie and Bailli tunnels are also among the priorities. Routine maintenance continues (carried out by the administration), but major structural renovation projects require:

- A multi-year budget commitment (envelopes of several tens of millions of euros per tunnel)
- A political choice on priorities
- Often, coordination with other projects (Good Move, cycling infrastructure)

### Good Move — Regional Mobility Plan

Good Move is the regional mobility plan adopted in 2020. The neighbourhood zones already implemented continue to function. However, **the rollout of new neighbourhood zones and adjustments based on citizen feedback** require government decisions. In caretaker mode, only minor adjustments are possible.

## What continues to function

- **STIB**: daily operations (bus, tram, metro) continue normally under the existing management contract
- **Villo** and **Jump/Lime**: shared mobility services under existing concessions
- **Routine road maintenance**: potholes, signage, traffic lights
- **Already approved works**: construction sites launched before June 2024 continue

## Why this matters

Mobility is the most visible domain for Brussels residents in their daily lives. Each day of delay in infrastructure projects has a cost:

- Economic cost (congestion, time lost)
- Environmental cost (delay in the transition to public transport)
- Social cost (accessibility of underserved neighbourhoods)

Precise data on these costs is difficult to estimate as it depends on complex modelling. BGM does not publish a quantified estimate of the economic cost of these delays to avoid unsourced speculation.
