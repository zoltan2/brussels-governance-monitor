## Government agreement: announced impacts
According to corroborating press sources, the agreement of 12 February 2026 includes several measures that impact the education and training sector:

- **70% employment target**: vocational training is a central lever for achieving this goal. Bruxelles Formation and accredited training providers will be called upon to strengthen qualifying pathways
- **Actiris support deadline reduced** from 5 to 3 months: this acceleration requires closer coordination between Actiris, Bruxelles Formation and VDAB Brussels
- **Bilingualism: raised ambitions** -- the agreement announces a strengthening of bilingualism, which could revive the bilingual education pilot projects suspended since June 2024
- **Administrative reform (merger of pillars)**: Bruxelles Formation could be affected by the reorganisation of the 25 regional structures into 3 to 4 entities

**Point of attention**: the end of the caretaker period allows training programmes, school renovations and frozen education subsidies to be unblocked. However, the budgetary effort means that not all pending initiatives will be funded simultaneously.

## Childcare crisis (February 2026)

### A structural deficit

For 2 out of 3 parents, finding a childcare place remains "difficult or very difficult" (Ligue des Familles). The deficit reaches **up to 10,000 places** in the Brussels Region to guarantee equal access.

Between 2019 and 2023, the Federation Wallonia-Brussels lost **more than 1,500 places** due to bankruptcies and closures of childcare facilities.

### Plan Cigogne

Plan Cigogne provides for **1,700 new places** in Brussels and 1,800 in Wallonia (3,500 in total). But opening a single childcare place requires **7 to 9 years** of administrative procedures and construction.

### FWB cuts to early childhood

The 2026 FWB budget provides for **74 million EUR in cuts** to the early childhood sector (ONE, nurseries, childcare centres) -- while the shortage persists. The non-indexation of subsidies compounds these reductions.

Cumulative FWB savings reach **500 million EUR over 4 years** (2026-2029), affecting education, early childhood, culture, youth and sport.
