## Coalition Agreement: Announced Commitments

> **Note**: The official text of the Regional Policy Declaration (DPR) has not yet been published. The measures below are based on concordant press sources (RTBF, La Libre, DH, BX1, VRT NWS, BRUZZ). They will be updated once the official document is available.

According to concordant press sources, the agreement of 12 February 2026 announces measures for the cultural sector:

- **Kanal saved**: **EUR 60 million** for the opening of the contemporary art museum (former Citroen garage). The annual operating budget will be degressive, with a requirement to seek own revenue
- **Review of discretionary subsidies**: all regional subsidy envelopes will be re-examined as part of the EUR 1.2 billion fiscal consolidation effort

**Point of attention**: the rescue of Kanal (EUR 60M) is a major investment, but the systematic review of discretionary subsidies could affect other regional cultural institutions. The details of the overall cultural arbitration are not yet known.

The following sections document the inherited situation and contextual data.

## Brussels, a cultural capital under pressure

Brussels occupies a unique place in the European cultural landscape. As a bilingual city at the heart of Europe, it is home to approximately **300 subsidised cultural institutions** and generates some **15,000 jobs** in the cultural sector. Theatres, museums, art centres, concert halls, galleries, dance companies and artistic collectives make the capital an internationally recognised creative hub.

The funding of this cultural vitality relies on a system involving **several levels of government** that must be clearly distinguished:

- **Community (FWB, Flemish Community)**: the majority of cultural subsidies in Brussels. Multi-year programme contracts, accreditations and structural funding for major institutions fall under Community competence. This level **continues to operate**, but without indexation of funding envelopes.
- **Regional (Brussels-Capital Region)**: co-funding of cultural projects, one-off subsidies, regional accreditations, inter-level coordination. This level has been **frozen** since 9 June 2024.
- **Municipal**: municipal subsidies for local initiatives, provision of venues and infrastructure. This level continues but some communes have made budget cuts.

Since 9 June 2024, the **specifically regional** mechanisms have been frozen. Community competences continue but are progressively eroding due to non-indexation.

## Cultural subsidies: the heart of the problem

### The mechanism

The Brussels-Capital Region devotes an annual budget of approximately **EUR 120 million** to cultural policies, directly or through the community commissions. These funds finance the operations of cultural institutions, artistic programming, artist residencies, cultural mediation projects and support for emerging creators.

### What is blocked

Under a caretaker government, the entire system of regional cultural funding is frozen:

- **No new subsidies** for emerging cultural projects
- **No revaluation** of existing allocations to account for inflation
- **No additional support** for structures in financial difficulty
- **No regional calls for proposals** for artistic creation

Institutions receiving structural subsidies committed before June 2024 continue to receive them. But every new application goes unanswered.

## Festivals: a nuanced situation

### The Kunstenfestivaldesarts

The **Kunstenfestivaldesarts**, an internationally renowned performing arts festival, is primarily funded by the **Federation Wallonia-Brussels** and the **Flemish Community** (community competence). These multi-year subsidies **continue to be disbursed**, even without a regional government. The festival is therefore **not directly threatened** by the regional crisis.

However, the regional co-funding share cannot be renewed or increased under a caretaker government, which limits room for development.

### Events more directly affected

Festivals and events that rely more heavily on **specifically regional** funding are more exposed:

- Events linked to Brussels heritage (regional competence)
- Intercultural and bilingual events characteristic of Brussels
- The Zinneke Parade and Image de Bruxelles festivals, whose regional funding is significant

### The concrete consequences

- **Postponed ambitious projects**: productions requiring regional co-production are suspended
- **Loss of international partnerships**: foreign institutions hesitate to commit without regional co-funding guarantees
- **Increased precarity for artists**: fewer commissions and residencies funded at the regional level

## Community centres: the local cultural fabric

### The role of the centres

Cultural and community centres form the local cultural network across the 19 Brussels municipalities. They offer spaces for creation, dissemination and artistic practice accessible to all audiences, and play an essential role in neighbourhood social cohesion.

### The impact of the freeze

Allocations to regional community centres cannot be increased or redirected. In practice:

- **No refinancing** to offset inflation of operating costs (energy, rent, equipment)
- **No new missions** entrusted to the centres (digital mediation, reaching new audiences)
- **No investment** in the renovation of local cultural infrastructure
- **No adaptation** of programming to the changing needs of neighbourhoods

Centres that have been operating on tight budgets for years see their room for manoeuvre shrink further.

## Cultural accreditations: the door closed to new initiatives

Under a caretaker government, no new accreditation can be issued to cultural structures. This blocks:

- The **official recognition** of new companies or artistic collectives
- **Access to public funding** for young structures
- **Changes to accreditation** for institutions wishing to expand their activities
- The **creation of new cultural venues** requiring regional accreditation

## What continues to function

### Community funding (the majority)

The **majority of cultural subsidies** in Brussels come from the community level: the Federation Wallonia-Brussels and the Flemish Community fully exercise their cultural competences, independently of the regional crisis. Multi-year programme contracts are maintained. However, the absence of indexation is causing a **progressive erosion** of real funding, estimated at several percentage points per year.

### Ongoing regional structural funding

Regional structural subsidies committed before June 2024 continue to be disbursed. Beneficiary institutions receive their allocations under existing agreements.

### Artistic autonomy

Cultural institutions with their own reserves, box office revenues, community funding or private funding continue to programme their seasons. Artistic creation does not stop, but complementary regional resources are frozen.

## The populations most affected

The freeze on regional cultural mechanisms affects people unevenly:

- **Young creators** who cannot access their first public funding
- **Emerging companies** whose projects remain shelved
- **Audiences in working-class neighbourhoods** who depend on community centres for access to culture
- **Intermittent cultural workers** whose work opportunities are shrinking
- **Artists not affiliated with major institutions**, who are more dependent on one-off subsidies

## What BGM does not say

This card **does not say** that all cultural funding in Brussels is blocked. The majority of cultural subsidies come from the community level (Federation Wallonia-Brussels, Flemish Community), where multi-year commitments continue. The regional crisis affects the **specifically regional** levers -- co-funding, regional accreditations, inter-level coordination -- and not the entire system.

Furthermore, the cultural sector faces pressures from **other levels of government** that are not linked to the regional crisis: non-indexation of community programme contracts, federal budget cuts to national institutions, VAT increases on leisure, reductions to Creative Europe at the European level. These factors accumulate alongside the regional freeze but do not stem from it.

## Outlook

The Brussels cultural sector survived the health crisis thanks to emergency mechanisms. But the current institutional crisis is different: it does not trigger exceptional support measures. The freeze is silent, gradual and cumulative.

Each season without an active cultural policy represents an impoverishment of the offering, a loss of talent and a weakening of Brussels' international reputation as a cultural capital.
