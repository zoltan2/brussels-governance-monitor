## What happened

From 10 September 2025, the royal facilitator initiated a series of structured consultations with the two linguistic groups of the Brussels Parliament. The approach differed fundamentally from that of previous formateurs and informateurs: the facilitator addressed the linguistic groups as such, rather than individual parties.

## The method

The facilitator organised consultations in three phases:

1. **Separate phase**: distinct consultations with the French-speaking linguistic group and the Dutch-speaking linguistic group, to understand the positions and expectations of each
2. **Shuttle phase**: the facilitator acted as intermediary between the two groups, transmitting proposals and counter-proposals
3. **Joint phase**: plenary meetings with both groups to attempt to establish a common framework

## The points of divergence

The consultations revealed a deep divide on governance:

- **French-speaking side**: insistence on demographic proportionality (French-speaking residents of Brussels are a clear majority) in regional decision-making
- **Dutch-speaking side**: demand for reinforced representation guarantees, veto mechanisms or special majorities to protect the Dutch-speaking minority

## The assessment

The facilitator concluded that the problem extended beyond coalition negotiations: it was the very model of bilingual governance in Brussels that was being called into question. A lasting solution would potentially require institutional adjustments that go beyond the scope of a simple government formation.
