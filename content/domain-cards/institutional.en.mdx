## Upcoming institutional milestones

The institutional timetable is tight. The agenda for the plenary session of 23 February has been officially published by the Brussels Parliament:

- **Monday 23 February** — the Minister-President presents the Regional Policy Declaration (RPD) to the Brussels Parliament (item 1: RPD, item 2: general debate)
- **Wednesday 25 February** — confidence vote in the Brussels Parliament

These two milestones will mark the formal start of the government's mandate and the entry into force of the legislative programme.

## Bilingualism: commitment and controversy

The RPD lists bilingualism as an institutional priority. The Minister-President publicly acknowledged his insufficient command of Dutch, stating he owes it to Brussels residents to improve. The Dutch-language press covered this issue extensively, highlighting its significance in an officially bilingual region. The issue remains sensitive in the Brussels-Capital Region, where institutional bilingualism is a legal obligation.

The delay in finalising the Dutch-language version of the RPD — still unavailable five days after the agreement, according to BRUZZ (17 February 2026) — has reignited the debate on institutional bilingualism. The language question remains a structural issue in Belgium: the 1831 Constitution only received an official Dutch text in 1967 — for 136 years, only the French text had legal standing. The German version was not adopted until 1991.

## COCOF presidency (unconfirmed)

According to press reports (La Libre Belgique, February 2026), the COCOF presidency remained unassigned as of 18 February 2026. Both PS and Les Engagés are reportedly claiming the position. This appointment, expected in the coming weeks, has not yet been officially agreed upon.

## RPD commitments

The Regional Policy Declaration of 13 February 2026 provides for the most ambitious restructuring in the history of the Brussels administration. Chapter 4 details the merger of 25 regional structures into 4 pillars.
