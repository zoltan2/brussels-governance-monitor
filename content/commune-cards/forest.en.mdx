## An unprecedented left-wing coalition

Forest has approximately 56,000 inhabitants and is marked by the formation of an unprecedented coalition in Brussels: **PS-PTB-Ecolo**. The MR-DéFI list, which came first with 10 seats, was excluded from power. Charles Spapens (PS) is mayor.

## Transparency: 5 out of 6 criteria

Forest achieves a good score. The **budget** and council **minutes** (archived PDFs) are published online, the council is broadcast via **livestream** on YouTube, the **mandate registry** is accessible, and the municipality has a **Forest Citizen Council** facilitated by Dreamocracy. No dedicated **Open Data** portal.

## Citizen participation: Forest Citizen Council

Forest established a **Forest Citizen Council** with the help of Dreamocracy, allowing residents to participate directly in municipal decisions. A citizen initiative right with public consultation completes the framework.
