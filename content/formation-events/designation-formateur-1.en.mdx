## What happened

On 1 August 2024, the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region officially designated a formateur from the MR to lead negotiations for the formation of a new regional government. This designation followed a brief phase of informal exploratory contacts between party leaders, in the wake of the regional elections of 9 June 2024.

## Why the MR

The choice of a formateur from the MR was explained by the election results: the party achieved the highest score among French-speaking parties in the Brussels Parliament. In keeping with convention, it is generally the largest French-speaking party that takes the initiative in the formation process.

## The mandate

The formateur received a mandate from the President of Parliament to explore coalition possibilities and negotiate a government agreement. No formal deadline was set, in accordance with the Special Institutional Reform Act of 12 January 1989, which does not provide for a binding timetable for the formation process.
