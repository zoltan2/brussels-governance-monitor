## What happened

On 25 January 2026, five days after the resignation of the third formateur, several thousand Brussels residents took to the streets of the capital to demand the formation of a regional government. The demonstration, organised by a citizen collective born on social media, brought together participants from all linguistic communities.

## The context

The demonstration came against a backdrop of growing exasperation:
- The Region had been in caretaker mode for more than 19 months
- Five formation attempts had failed
- Public services were showing signs of deterioration
- The regional budget had been running on provisional twelfths for over a year

## The demands

The demonstrators carried simple, cross-community demands:

- **A government now**: an end to interminable negotiations
- **Priorities first**: a demand for a government that tackles concrete problems (housing, mobility, budget) rather than institutional quarrels
- **Political accountability**: a demand that the parties blocking the formation be held to account

## The significance

This demonstration marked a turning point in the crisis. For the first time, the formation of a regional government became a citizen cause and no longer merely a political game between parties. The popular pressure created a new dynamic that the parties could not ignore.
