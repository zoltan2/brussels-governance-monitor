## What happened

In August 2025, the formation negotiations came to a virtual standstill. Plenary meetings between the six parties became rare, replaced by informal bilateral contacts that produced no concrete progress.

## A summer in slow motion

Several factors contributed to the stalemate:

- **The calendar**: the summer period reduced the availability of negotiators
- **Political fatigue**: after more than a year of formation, negotiating teams showed signs of exhaustion
- **Absence of external pressure**: without parliamentary sessions, media and political pressure diminished
- **Unresolved disagreements**: the budget and portfolio allocation remained the two blocking points with no compromise in sight

## The formateur in deadlock

The formateur found himself in an uncomfortable position. Unable to present a budget paper accepted by all partners, yet not formally resigning, hoping for a dynamic restart in September. On 15 August 2025, a communication was addressed to the President of Parliament acknowledging the stalling of the mission.

## The consequence

Faced with this situation, the President of Parliament decided to take an unprecedented initiative: to designate a facilitator charged with resolving the deadlock between the linguistic groups. Unlike at federal level, the King plays no role in the formation of Brussels regional governments -- it is Parliament that steers the process. The recourse to a facilitator, distinct from a formateur or informateur, reflected the exceptional gravity of the crisis.
