The linguistic groups are a structural component of the Brussels Parliament. The 89 members are divided into two groups: the French linguistic group (72 members, elected on French-speaking lists) and the Dutch linguistic group (17 members, elected on Dutch-speaking lists). This division is not based on the elected representatives' mother tongue but on the choice of the electoral list on which they stood.

This bilingual structure lies at the heart of Brussels institutional functioning. It determines the special majority mechanisms for certain decisions, the alarm bell procedure that allows a linguistic group to suspend the examination of a text deemed prejudicial, and the composition of the government, which must include members from both groups.

The existence of linguistic groups gives particular complexity to coalition formation in Brussels. Since the government must rely on a majority in both linguistic groups for certain matters, negotiations are not solely about the total number of seats but also about the balances within each group, which multiplies constraints and lengthens the formation process.
