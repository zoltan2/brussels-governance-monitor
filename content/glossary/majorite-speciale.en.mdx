The special majority is a reinforced voting mechanism applicable to certain matters in the Brussels Parliament. Unlike a simple majority (more than half of those voting), the special majority requires that the decision be approved by an absolute majority of the members of each of the two linguistic groups. This system was designed to prevent the French linguistic group, which is numerically dominant, from adopting decisions affecting the interests of the Dutch-speaking community on its own.

This mechanism applies notably to ordinances relating to the rights of persons belonging to linguistic groups and to certain sensitive institutional matters. It constitutes one of the cornerstones of linguistic rights protection in the Brussels institutional system.

The special majority requirement has a direct impact on coalition negotiations: the future government must not only hold an overall majority in Parliament but also ensure a majority within the Dutch linguistic group. This additional constraint complicates government formation and contributes to the lengthening of negotiation periods documented by the Brussels Governance Monitor.
