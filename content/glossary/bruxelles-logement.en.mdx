Bruxelles Logement is the housing administration of the Brussels Regional Public Service (SPRB), in charge of housing policy in the Brussels-Capital Region. Its missions cover a broad spectrum: managing housing assistance, monitoring housing quality, granting rental allowances, regulating the rental market and coordinating social housing policy.

The administration plays an essential role in a Region where pressure on the housing market is particularly intense. High rents, the shortage of social housing and energy poverty in many buildings make housing a major social issue for Brussels residents. Bruxelles Logement is at the centre of these challenges, working alongside the Housing Fund (Fonds du Logement) and social housing companies.

Under a caretaker government, Bruxelles Logement continues to carry out its operational missions but cannot implement new policy orientations. Reforms of the rental market, extensions to housing assistance or the strengthening of quality standards require full government decisions, which remain suspended until the formation process is concluded.
