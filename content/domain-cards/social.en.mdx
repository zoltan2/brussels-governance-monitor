## Coalition Agreement: Announced Commitments

> **Note**: The official text of the Regional Policy Declaration (DPR) has not yet been published. The measures below are based on concordant press sources (RTBF, La Libre, DH, BX1, VRT NWS, BRUZZ). They will be updated once the official document is available.

The agreement of 12 February 2026 includes cross-cutting social and security measures:

- **EUR 10 million/year** for security at the Midi and Nord stations (cameras, police, cleaning, support for vulnerable people)
- **Regional drug commissioner**: creation of a dedicated function
- **Protection of social services**: homelessness, addiction, support services confirmed
- **Enhanced security role** of the minister-president
- **Kanal saved**: EUR 60 million for the museum opening (degressive annual budget, requirement to seek own revenue)

**Points of attention**: COCOM (bicommunal health) details have not yet been published, and health spending cuts are still under negotiation. The pressure on CPAS from the unemployment reform (>EUR 1 billion cumulative) will need to be absorbed by the new budgetary framework.

The following sections document the inherited situation and contextual data.

## A sector under growing pressure

The Brussels social sector faces a convergence of crises: the federal unemployment reform is pushing tens of thousands of people towards CPAS, COCOM bicommunal investments are frozen due to the absence of a government, and needs in homelessness and mental health continue to rise.

### Poverty in Brussels: the StatBel figures

According to the EU-SILC 2025 survey (Statbel), **37.3% of Brussels residents** are at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE indicator), more than **double the national average** (16.5%). This is the highest rate of all Belgian regions.

Precariousness also shows in daily life: **38.3% of Brussels residents** report being unable to face an unexpected expense of EUR 1,100, compared with 31.4% in Wallonia and 13.2% in Flanders. The poverty threshold is set at **EUR 1,565/month** for a single person and **EUR 3,287/month** for a household of 2 adults and 2 children.

With **1,255,795 inhabitants** (1 January 2025) and a density of approximately 7,700 inhabitants/km2, Brussels concentrates the social challenges of the country's largest agglomeration in a confined space. It is the only Belgian region where the natural balance remains positive (+5,330), but the internal exodus to Flanders and Wallonia (-17,993) reflects a structural departure of higher-income households.

The Common Community Commission (COCOM/GGC), responsible for bipersonal matters in Brussels (social welfare, health, elderly care, disability), has been in caretaker mode since June 2024. Its executive arm, Iriscare, continues its basic functions but cannot launch any new initiatives.

## CPAS under pressure

### The influx linked to the unemployment reform

The federal unemployment reform, which came into force on 1 January 2026, excludes tens of thousands of Brussels residents from unemployment benefits. These people turn to CPAS to obtain the **Social Integration Income (RIS)**.

At the end of 2024, approximately **47,000 people** were receiving the RIS in the Brussels Region (source: IBSA / FPS Social Integration). This figure is on a structural upward trend, and the full impact of the unemployment reform will only be felt during 2026.

### First wave: real figures (January 2026)

The first impact figures from the unemployment reform on Brussels CPAS are now available. In January 2026, CPAS recorded **243 presentations** from people who had lost their right to benefits, of which **67 RIS applications were approved**. These figures, below the most alarmist projections, are explained by a latency effect: the real shock is expected in **March-April 2026**, once waiting periods and appeals are exhausted.

### The burden on municipalities

The 19 Brussels CPAS are funded partly by the federal level (RIS reimbursement) and partly by the municipalities. Federal compensation is degressive:

- **100%** in the first year for new recipients coming from unemployment
- **90%** in the second year
- **75%** from the fourth year onwards

This degressive schedule gradually shifts the burden to municipalities, whose budgets are already constrained. Brulocalis and RTBF estimate that the cumulative cost of the unemployment reform for Belgian CPAS exceeds **EUR 1 billion**. For the 19 Brussels CPAS, the impact could reach several tens of millions of euros per year from 2027.

### Recruitment: an important nuance

CPAS have been able to hire **38 social workers** and **14 administrative staff** thanks to targeted federal funds (unemployment reform compensation). This reinforcement is real but remains insufficient given the expected influx: CPAS estimate they need 3 to 5 times more staff to absorb the March 2026 shock.

### What CPAS cannot do

- Launch structural socio-professional integration programmes (regional competence)
- Adapt services to growing needs without a new regional budget envelope

## Frozen COCOM investments

### The role of COCOM

The Common Community Commission is the bicommunal institution responsible for personal welfare and health matters in Brussels. It funds and regulates:

- Residential care homes
- Home care
- Mental health services
- Homelessness policy
- Childcare (bicommunal component)

### What is blocked

In caretaker mode, COCOM operates on provisional twelfths. In practice:

- **No new accreditations** for social welfare services
- **No refinancing** of expired multi-year agreements
- **No new places** in residential care homes, despite an ageing population
- **No expansion** of outpatient mental health services

Iriscare, the public interest body that implements COCOM policy, continues to process routine files but describes the situation as "operating at minimum capacity".

## Family allowances under pressure

### 308,000 children concerned

Brussels family allowances, managed by COCOM through the public operator Famiris and three private operators, cover more than **308,000 children** in the Brussels Region. This budget item is one of the largest for COCOM.

### Savings at the expense of families

Faced with the budgetary constraints of caretaker government, several savings measures have already been taken:

- **Permanent reduction of EUR 10/month** for children born before 2020
- **Elimination of the EUR 12/month supplement** that was planned for 2026
- **Total savings achieved**: approximately **EUR 33 million** at the expense of Brussels families

### The centralisation reform

In February 2026, a reform aims to centralise the payment of family allowances through a single operator (Famiris), instead of the current four operators. The goal is an additional saving of **EUR 8 million per year** through administrative rationalisation.

This reform is part of a spending review conducted by Brussels budget negotiators. Civil society organisations have written to the negotiators to request the preservation of current amounts and their indexation.

Sources: Le Soir (7 February 2026), BX1, Famiris.

## Homelessness policy at a standstill

### The figures

The last census conducted by Bruss'Help in November 2024 counted **9,777 homeless or houseless persons** in Brussels — +24.5% in two years. This figure is on a steady upward trend: it was 5,313 in 2020 and 7,134 in 2022.

### What is missing

The homelessness action plan requires political decisions that the caretaker government cannot take:

- **Housing First**: no extension of the programme despite proven results
- **Emergency shelter places**: the winter shelter system operates, but making places permanent requires a multi-year budget commitment
- **Transitional housing**: no new agreements between COCOM and municipalities
- **Coordination of stakeholders**: Bruss'Help provides operational coordination, but without new policy direction

## Field services under pressure

### Health outreach patrols threatened

Night-time health outreach patrols -- mobile teams that visit homeless persons to provide front-line medical care -- are threatened with suspension. The operating budget has not been renewed under the caretaker arrangement. These patrols are often the **only medical contact** for the most vulnerable people.

### Athena medical centre closes

After 10 years of operation, the Athena medical centre (free consultations for people without coverage) closed its doors in early February 2026, due to a lack of structural funding. The centre served undocumented persons, asylum seekers and Brussels residents in extreme precarity.

### In-work poverty

According to Vivalis (Brussels Social Barometer), **9.6% of Brussels workers** live below the poverty line despite being employed, compared with 4.7% nationally. This rate, more than double the Belgian average, reflects the concentration in Brussels of precarious, part-time and low-paid jobs.

## Mental health: growing needs without a response

The COVID-19 pandemic caused a lasting increase in mental health needs, particularly among young people and vulnerable populations. Brussels mental health services are saturated, with waiting lists of several months.

In caretaker mode:

- **No new mental health initiatives** have been launched since June 2024
- Existing **mobile crisis teams** continue to operate, but without reinforcement
- The **Brussels Mental Health Network** has not received additional resources
- **Agreements with hospitals** for psychiatric emergencies have not been renewed

## What continues to function

- **Iriscare**: routine management of accreditations, payments to providers, inspections
- **CPAS**: RIS allocation, social assistance, individual support
- **Bruss'Help**: coordination of the homelessness sector, census, winter plan
- **Accredited mental health services**: consultations within their current capacity
- **Winter shelter scheme**: emergency accommodation during the winter period

## Why this matters

The social sector is the last safety net for Brussels' most vulnerable residents. Nearly 10,000 people live without housing. When the unemployment reform excludes tens of thousands of people, homelessness is rising and mental health needs are surging, the Region's inability to take structural decisions has a direct human cost. CPAS, Iriscare and the voluntary sector absorb the shocks with existing resources, but every month without a government postpones the structural responses that Brussels needs.
