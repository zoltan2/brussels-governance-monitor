## What happened

On 20 July 2025, after several weeks of fruitless negotiations, the formateur acknowledged a deadlock on two interconnected fronts: the distribution of ministerial portfolios and the budgetary framework.

## The portfolio impasse

With six parties called upon to form a government of five ministers and three state secretaries, the allocation of portfolios proved extremely complex. Each party demanded strategic competences to justify its participation to its voters. The main points of friction:

- Several parties vied for the same competences (housing, mobility)
- The balance between French-speaking and Dutch-speaking portfolios added an extra layer of complexity
- The smaller coalition partners refused to settle for secondary portfolios

## The budget impasse

At the same time, the parties failed to agree on the budgetary framework:

- Some partners wanted an ambitious investment budget, even at the cost of increasing regional debt
- Others insisted on fiscal discipline and a swift return to balanced finances
- The question of refinancing public services after a year of provisional twelfths proved divisive

## The stalemate

The formateur attempted several compromises, but each proposal satisfied some partners at the expense of others. The goal of reaching an agreement before the September session now appeared unrealistic.
