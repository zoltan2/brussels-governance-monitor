## What happened

On Sunday 8 February 2026, the MR president announced via social media that he was in a position to initiate "a genuine negotiation process" to provide Brussels with a government "in the very next few days". He convened a first meeting for Monday 9 February at 2:30 PM.

## The proposed configuration

The envisaged coalition brings together **7 parties** commanding a double linguistic majority:

- **French-speaking side**: MR, PS, Les Engagés
- **Dutch-speaking side**: Groen, Vooruit, Anders (ex-Open VLD), CD&V

This configuration notably excludes the **N-VA**, which had been a partner in the first formation attempts. It builds on the July 2024 agreement between MR, PS and Les Engagés as a negotiation basis.

## Party reactions

Initial reactions are cautious but open:

- **Les Engagés** describe the announcement as "excellent news"
- **Anders** and **PS** convene their party bodies to discuss it
- **CD&V** confirms its openness to negotiations
- **Groen** and **Vooruit** are examining the proposal

## The context

This initiative comes one week after the citizen roundtable of 1 February (Respect Brussels), during which vetoes were lifted and the principle of "defusers" was launched. Citizen pressure appears to have contributed to accelerating contacts between the parties.

## What this means

If this negotiation succeeds, it would end a crisis of more than **610 days** — the longest in the history of the Brussels Region. However, previous attempts have each time failed on last-minute blockages, and no agreement has been signed yet. The BGM confidence level remains **"unconfirmed"** until a formal agreement is announced.
