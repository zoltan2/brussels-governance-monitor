## Government agreement: announced impacts

According to corroborating press sources, the agreement of 12 February 2026 includes several measures that directly impact the nonprofit sector:

- **Review of discretionary subsidies**: as part of the budgetary effort of approximately EUR 1 billion, all regional subsidy envelopes will be re-examined. The nonprofit sector, the main beneficiary of discretionary subsidies, is directly concerned
- **Administrative reform (merger of pillars)**: the 25 regional structures will be merged into 3 to 4 entities. The bodies that manage accreditations and association agreements will be reorganised
- **Stricter activation of jobseekers**: the strengthening of Actiris and the target of a 70% employment rate in Brussels directly concern socio-professional integration operators (FeBISP, CBCS)
- **Actiris support period reduced** from 5 to 3 months -- integration associations are on the front line of this support

**Point of attention**: the end of the caretaker period makes it possible to unblock the multi-year agreements and accreditations that have been frozen since June 2024. However, the simultaneous budgetary effort means that the amounts released could be lower than the sector's expectations.

## Impact of the 600+ days without a government (February 2026)

### The scale of the shock

The Brussels nonprofit sector -- **over 5,000 associations** and **105,000 workers** -- was severely impacted by more than 600 days without a fully empowered regional government. Sectoral federations documented a **triple blockage**:

1. **Inability to launch** new policies or programmes
2. **Inability to adapt** to reforms at other levels of government (e.g. federal indexation reform)
3. **Absence of a structuring 2025 budget** -- operating on provisional twelfths

### Concrete cases

- **Apis Bruoc Sella** (environmental ASBL): five-year agreement expired in early 2026, forced to reduce operations, missions suspended, fixed-term contracts not renewed
- **Projet Lama** (precarity and addictions): the socio-health scheme "Cover" threatened due to lack of refinancing

The RAB/BKO (168 cultural actors) described the situation as "unbearable uncertainty". Other federations, including CBCS and FeBISP, report similar situations in the integration and social welfare sectors.

### COCOF and VGC confirmed

The installation of the COCOF (20 February 2026, MR-PS-Engages majority) makes it possible to unblock the French-speaking community competences affecting the nonprofit sector: French-speaking cultural subsidies, continuing education, personal assistance. The budgetary impact remains to be clarified.

On the Dutch-speaking side, the **VGC** college has also been installed, under the presidency of Elke Van den Brandt (Groen). The VGC subsidises the Dutch-speaking nonprofit sector in Brussels (welfare, culture, youth) and manages the 22 community centres (gemeenschapscentra). The unblocking on the Dutch-speaking side is effective.
