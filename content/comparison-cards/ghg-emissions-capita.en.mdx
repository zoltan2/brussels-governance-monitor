methodology: "Comparison of net greenhouse gas emissions per capita (in tonnes of CO2-equivalent), including land use and forestry (LULUCF), published by Eurostat as part of SDG monitoring. Data are at national level. Actual emissions from capital-city regions are generally lower than the national average (less industrial activity, higher public transport density), but no harmonised regional breakdown exists."

caveat: "Emissions are calculated at national level, not regional level. Capital-city regions generally have lower per-capita emissions than the national average (urbanisation, public transport, low heavy industry). The values presented are therefore upper-bound approximations for the capitals. Moreover, accounting methodologies may vary between countries (inclusion or exclusion of LULUCF, scope of indirect emissions)."

## Context

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per capita are an essential indicator for assessing a country's climate footprint. Eurostat publishes this data as part of the monitoring of Sustainable Development Goal 13 (climate action). The figures presented here are national averages for 2023, used as a proxy for capital-city regions in the absence of a harmonised regional breakdown.

## The data compared

The gap between the six countries is considerable. France has the lowest emissions (5.5 tonnes of CO2-equivalent per capita), a result largely attributable to its nuclear fleet, which provides low-carbon electricity. Denmark, at 5.8 tonnes, benefits from its massive investments in wind energy, which have sharply reduced the share of fossil fuels in its energy mix. At the opposite end, Germany has the highest emissions in the panel (10.8 tonnes), owing to its heavy industrial base and historical dependence on coal, although the trend is downward. Belgium (9.6 tonnes) and the Netherlands (9.1 tonnes) sit above the EU average, reflecting high industrial density and a transport network still heavily reliant on fossil fuels. Austria (8.2 tonnes) occupies a middle position, supported by its high share of hydroelectric power.

## Impact of the governance crisis in Brussels

In the Brussels-Capital Region, the absence of a fully empowered government since June 2024 has direct consequences for climate policy. The Air-Climate-Energy Plan (PACE), which sets the Region's emissions reduction targets, cannot be updated or strengthened without an authorised political body. Furthermore, the Renolution subsidies — the regional scheme funding the energy renovation of buildings — have been frozen since the transition to caretaker status. The building sector represents the primary source of GHG emissions in the Brussels Region (approximately 60% of direct emissions). This deadlock concretely delays the Region's capacity to reduce its carbon footprint, even as the European targets for 2030 draw closer.
