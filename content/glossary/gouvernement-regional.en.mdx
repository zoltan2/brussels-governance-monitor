The Brussels regional government is the executive body of the Brussels-Capital Region. It is composed of five members: a Minister-President and four ministers, along with three state secretaries. The special law requires the government to include members from both linguistic groups, with at least one Dutch-speaking minister, although the Minister-President is considered linguistically neutral.

The government is responsible for implementing ordinances passed by Parliament, preparing the budget and conducting regional policy in the areas of the Region's competence. It operates under the principle of collegiality: decisions are taken collectively by the regional council of ministers.

During a formation period, the absence of a full government constitutes a major blockage for the Region. A caretaker government cannot launch new policies, commit to structural investments or fully represent the Region in inter-regional and international forums. It is this situation that the Brussels Governance Monitor documents and analyses.
