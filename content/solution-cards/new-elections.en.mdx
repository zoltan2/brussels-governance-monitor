title: "Early regional elections"
slug: new-elections
locale: en
solutionType: constitutional
feasibility: near-zero
timeline: years
legalBasis: "Article 117 of the Belgian Constitution — regional parliaments have a fixed 5-year term. Article 46 (dissolution) applies only to the federal Parliament. Only a two-thirds majority in the federal Chamber could trigger early regional elections."
mechanism: "The federal Chamber of Representatives votes by a two-thirds majority to dissolve the Brussels Parliament and organise new regional elections. The King then sets the date of the ballot."
risks:
  - "The Brussels Parliament cannot dissolve itself — it has a fixed 5-year term"
  - "Requires a two-thirds majority in the federal Chamber — a nearly impossible threshold to reach"
  - "New elections would probably produce similar results without resolving the deadlock"
  - "No precedent in Belgian history for the dissolution of a regional parliament"
  - "Federal interference in regional affairs — perceived as an infringement on autonomy"

## Why this option is being discussed

Faced with the political deadlock in Brussels (600+ days without a government), some observers raise the possibility of new regional elections. The idea: if the current parties cannot reach an agreement, put the question to the voters.

## The constitutional obstacle

The Brussels Parliament **cannot be dissolved**. This is a fundamental constitutional rule.

### What the Constitution says

- **Article 117**: members of community and regional parliaments are elected for a 5-year term, coinciding with European elections
- **Article 46** (dissolution): applies only to the federal Chamber, not to regional parliaments
- The Special Act of 12 January 1989 on Brussels institutions confirms this rule

### The only theoretical path

The Chamber of Representatives (federal Parliament) could, in theory, vote to dissolve the Brussels Parliament. However, this measure would require a **two-thirds majority** — a threshold never reached for this type of decision in Belgian history.

## No precedent

No Belgian regional parliament has ever been dissolved early:

- **Flanders**: never dissolved
- **Wallonia**: never dissolved
- **Brussels**: never dissolved
- **Federal level**: dissolution in 2010 (via a declaration of constitutional revision — a mechanism inapplicable to the Regions)

## Why new elections would probably solve nothing

The Brussels deadlock is not an electoral accident — it is a structural problem:

1. **Dual linguistic majority**: any Brussels government must obtain a majority in the francophone group (72 seats) AND in the Dutch-speaking group (17 seats)
2. **Fragmentation**: the June 2024 results (MR 20, PS 16, PTB 15, Les Engages 8) reflect deep ideological divides
3. **Cross-vetoes**: the PS refuses any coalition including the N-VA; Flemish parties consider the N-VA indispensable
4. **New elections** would in all likelihood reproduce the same balance of power

## What alternatives exist

Constitutional experts who have studied the Brussels deadlock have identified other avenues:

- **Citizens' assembly** (Irish model 2012-2016) to unblock negotiations
- **Technocratic government** or government of experts
- **Federal intervention** (Article 45 of the Special Act — the Council of Ministers can suspend Brussels ordinances by royal decree), but this would mean an unprecedented loss of regional autonomy

## In summary

New elections are an instinctive solution but constitutionally near-impossible and politically ineffective. The Brussels problem is not "who was elected" but "how to form a majority in a system with a dual linguistic majority and deep ideological divides".
