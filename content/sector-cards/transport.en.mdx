## Coalition Agreement: Announced Decisions
The agreement of 12 February 2026 marks a historic shift for Brussels public transport:

- **Metro 3 frozen for 10 years** -- the project as conceived (extension to Bordet, EUR 4.6 billion) is abandoned in favour of a **tram completing the loop** of the existing network
- **Good Move replaced** by a new Regional Mobility Plan, with smaller zones (school areas)
- **Tram 15** (Gare du Nord -- Tour & Taxis): maintained
- **Constitution and Palais du Midi construction sites**: continued
- **LEZ**: maintained -- **annual pass at EUR 350** (reduced rate EUR 200), fine per violation reduced from 350 to **EUR 80**, 4-fine annual cap removed
- **STIB fares**: preferential youth/senior rates maintained
- **Contested bollards**: removal
- **2nd car-free Sunday** per year

The freeze on Metro 3 is the most structuring decision for the sector: it redirects billions of euros of investment towards the tramway and changes the mobility strategy for 10+ years.

## Court of Audit and STIB (February 2026)

### Metro 3: the report that sealed the project's fate

The **Court of Audit** (Cour des comptes) published a devastating report on Metro 3, putting the total cost at **EUR 4.76 billion** -- a **+477%** overrun compared to initial estimates of less than EUR 1 billion. The report highlights a 15-year delay and concludes that the financial sustainability of the project is "seriously compromised".

It was this report that led the negotiators to abandon the project in favour of a **tram along the route originally planned** for the metro.

### STIB: postponed investments

According to the details of the agreement published by DH (13 February 2026), STIB will need to achieve structural savings. Several technical investments are being postponed:

- **Fleet replacement** tram/metro: plan revised downward
- **Metro signalling modernisation**: studies postponed
- **Bus equipment orders**: rescheduled

However, **operational resources** (day-to-day operations) are maintained at the current level.
