## A market under extreme pressure

Housing in Brussels has been in structural crisis for years. The absence of a regional government since June 2024 has turned a difficult situation into a deadlock: no new programme can be launched, no major investment decided, no reform adopted.

### The historic waiting list

At the end of 2025, **62,234 households** are registered on the waiting list for social housing — an all-time record. This represents **10% of all Brussels households**. The average waiting time is **9 to 13 years** depending on the type of housing requested.

The Brussels social housing stock comprises approximately 42,000 dwellings, managed by 16 Public Service Real Estate Companies (SISPs). The ratio is simple: there are more households waiting than existing dwellings.

### The rent gap

The gulf between the social and private markets illustrates the urgency:

- **Average social rent**: EUR 412/month (end of 2024)
- **Average private rent**: EUR 1,321/month (first half of 2025, +5% year-on-year)
- For a one-bedroom apartment: approximately EUR 1,110/month at the start of 2026

Half of Brussels households meet the eligibility criteria for social housing. Supply covers only a fraction of demand.

## The Housing Fund at a standstill

On 1 July 2025, the Housing Fund **suspended all new credit applications**. The caretaker government refused a loan of EUR 50 million, with the budget minister citing the refusal to increase Brussels' debt.

### Suspended services

- Home purchase mortgages
- ECORENO credits (energy renovation)
- ECORENO consumer credits
- Investment credits for co-ownerships

Approximately **60,000 households** in Brussels waiting for affordable housing are directly affected. Around twenty employees in the credit department were placed on temporary unemployment.

### Banking pressure

In November 2024, Belfius withdrew a EUR 500 million credit line from the Housing Fund. Other banks refused tenders "to send a signal to Brussels politicians". The Fund's credit risk has not changed — the pressure is political.

## Rental allowances paid late

In December 2024, approximately **6,000 recipients** did not receive their rental allowance on time. The cause: no budget adjustment had been prepared since May 2024 (election year). The coffers were empty. Payments were finally made in early January 2025 thanks to provisional twelfths.

## What has been done despite everything

- **2,000 new social housing units** delivered between 2020 and 2024
- **7,500 dwellings renovated** over the same period
- **2,327 families** housed in social housing in 2024
- **EUR 2 billion** invested in social housing 2020-2024
- The **tenancy reform** (Housing Code) entered into force on 1 November 2024, adopted before the elections

## What is blocked

- **Alliance Habitat**: new phases frozen (original target: 6,720 new public housing units for EUR 953 million)
- **New construction projects**: on hold even with permits obtained
- **Rental allowance reform**: no structural overhaul possible
- **PAD** (Master Development Plans): Gare du Midi, Heysel frozen
- **SLRB** forced to sell approximately EUR 200 million in property assets, including nearly completed projects

## Why this matters

Housing is the largest expenditure item for Brussels households. When 10% of the population is waiting for social housing and the main financing tool is at a standstill, every month without a government deepens a social debt that will take years to address.
