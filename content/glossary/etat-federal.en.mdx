The Belgian federal state is the central level of government in Belgium's federal structure. It is responsible for matters concerning the entire country: social security, justice, federal taxation, national defence, railways (SNCB/NMBS), foreign policy and development cooperation. The federal Parliament is composed of the Chamber of Representatives (150 members) and the Senate.

The Arizona federal government, formed in 2025, is fully operational. It takes decisions that directly impact Brussels, particularly in social security, taxation and justice. Unlike the Brussels Region, the federal level has a full government capable of carrying out structural reforms.

This asymmetry between a functional federal government and a Brussels Region operating under caretaker status creates tensions. Federal reforms advance without Brussels being able to adapt its own policies accordingly. Federal financial transfers to the Region remain governed by the special financing law, but negotiations on possible revisions are complicated by the absence of a full regional interlocutor.
