The STIB (Societe des Transports Intercommunaux de Bruxelles; in Dutch: MIVB, Maatschappij voor het Intercommunaal Vervoer te Brussel) is the public transport operator of the Brussels-Capital Region. It operates a multimodal network comprising four metro lines, an extensive tram network and numerous bus routes. The STIB carries hundreds of thousands of passengers daily and constitutes a pillar of Brussels mobility.

As a public-law company, the STIB is placed under the supervision of the regional government, which defines its missions through a management contract. Its investments and development depend directly on regional political decisions, particularly regarding the budget and transport service planning.

The metro extension project (Metro 3) is the most significant dossier linked to the STIB. During a caretaker period, strategic decisions concerning network extension, funding of new infrastructure and the revision of the management contract can be delayed, impacting service quality and the network's capacity to meet the growing needs of users.
