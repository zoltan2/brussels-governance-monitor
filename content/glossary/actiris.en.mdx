Actiris is the Brussels regional employment office, the equivalent of Le Forem in Wallonia and the VDAB in Flanders. Its primary mission is to support Brussels jobseekers in their efforts, centralise job offers and implement regional employment policies. It plays a central role in a Brussels labour market characterised by an unemployment rate significantly higher than the national average.

Actiris also manages specific professional integration programmes, hiring incentive schemes and partnerships with economic actors in the Region. Its work is part of a broader socio-economic policy framework that includes vocational training, the social economy and innovation.

During a prolonged political crisis, the strategic orientations of Actiris cannot be fundamentally altered. The organisation continues to operate on the basis of its existing missions, but the reforms needed to adapt employment policy to labour market developments are postponed, with direct consequences for Brussels jobseekers.
