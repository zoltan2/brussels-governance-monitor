The Brussels-Capital Region is covered by six local police zones, each grouping one or more municipalities. The Brussels-Capital/Ixelles zone (the largest) covers the City of Brussels and Ixelles. The South zone groups Anderlecht, Forest and Saint-Gilles. The West zone covers Berchem-Sainte-Agathe, Ganshoren, Jette, Koekelberg and Molenbeek-Saint-Jean. The Marlow zone includes Uccle, Watermael-Boitsfort and Auderghem. The Montgomery zone covers Etterbeek, Woluwe-Saint-Lambert and Woluwe-Saint-Pierre. The North zone groups Evere, Saint-Josse-ten-Noode and Schaerbeek.

Each police zone is led by a chief of police and supervised by a police council and a police college composed of representatives from the relevant municipalities. They carry out community policing, public order maintenance and local investigations, in coordination with the federal police.

During a regional formation crisis, the police zones continue to function normally as they depend on the municipalities and not on the regional government. Their funding comes mainly from the municipalities and federal grants. However, certain security projects requiring regional coordination may be delayed in the absence of a full government.
