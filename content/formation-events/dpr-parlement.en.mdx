## Presentation of the DPR

The minister-president presents the Regional Policy Declaration (DPR) in plenary session at the Brussels Parliament on Monday 23 February 2026 at 4:30 pm. The document, resulting from the agreement of the seven coalition parties, details the government's commitments for the legislature.

The presentation had been postponed due to the parliamentary recess — Parliament was not in session the week following the swearing-in ceremony of 14 February.
