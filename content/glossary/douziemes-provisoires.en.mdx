Provisional twelfths (French: douziemes provisoires) are an emergency budgetary mechanism applied when an annual budget has not been passed by parliament, typically under a caretaker government. Each month, the government is authorised to spend one twelfth of the previous year's budget, thereby ensuring the continuity of public services and the payment of mandatory expenditure.

While this system avoids the complete paralysis of the administration, it imposes major constraints. No new expenditure can be committed, no ambitious programme can be launched, and structural investments are frozen. For the Brussels-Capital Region, this means the impossibility of launching new public procurement or adapting policies to current needs.

The consequences of provisional twelfths are particularly severe during a prolonged crisis: infrastructure deteriorates, projects such as Metro 3 fall behind schedule, and the Region risks losing access to certain European funds that require a budgetary commitment only a full government can guarantee.
