## Context

The federal government adopted an unemployment system reform in early 2026 aimed at limiting the duration of benefits and strengthening job search requirements. This reform has a direct impact on the Regions, which are responsible for the guidance and training of jobseekers through their public services (VDAB in Flanders, Forem in Wallonia, Actiris in Brussels).

## Flanders: immediate activation

The VDAB, the Flemish public employment service, activated an emergency plan as soon as the reform was announced:

- **Enhanced individual support**: increase in the number of counsellors assigned to long-term jobseeker follow-up
- **Additional budgets**: the Flemish government released supplementary funds for training and retraining
- **Targeted programmes**: launch of specific measures for the groups most affected by tightened conditions

The Flemish unemployment rate (~3.2%) allows for a relative absorption of the reform's effects, as the labour market is tight in many sectors.

## Wallonia: partial response

The Forem intensified certain support actions but without additional budget:

- **Targeted intensification**: reallocation of internal resources towards affected groups
- **No comprehensive emergency plan**: the recently installed Walloon government prioritised other budget areas
- **Training**: extension of certain existing programmes, without new schemes

The Walloon unemployment rate (~8.5%) is higher than in Flanders, making the regional population more vulnerable to the reform's effects.

## Brussels: inability to act

Actiris, the Brussels employment service, cannot launch new measures:

- **Government in caretaker mode**: no new policy can be decided
- **Budget on provisional twelfths**: no additional resources available
- **Continuation of existing programmes only**: Actiris continues its regular missions but without adaptation to the federal reform

The Brussels unemployment rate (~12.7%), the highest of the three Regions, makes this inability to act particularly concerning. Brussels concentrates a disproportionate share of long-term jobseekers who will be the first affected by tightened conditions.

## The structural challenge

This situation highlights a specific risk of the Brussels institutional crisis: when a federal reform changes the environment, Regions with a fully empowered government can adapt. Brussels, in caretaker mode, cannot. Brussels jobseekers face both the federal tightening and the absence of a regional response.
