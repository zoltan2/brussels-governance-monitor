## What is the ACS scheme?

**Agents Contractuels Subventionnés** (ACS, Subsidised Contract Workers) are the main employment support mechanism for the Brussels non-profit sector. The scheme works through a dual lever: a **regional premium** (indexed to civil service pay scales) and a **reduction in employer social security contributions** to 0.56%. Positions are intended for jobseekers registered with Actiris, with eligibility conditions linked to unemployment duration, age, or disability.

By end 2017, approximately **10,000 positions** were subsidised across **1,312 employers**: over 7,000 in non-profits and administrations ("Programme Law" positions) and approximately 2,500 in local authorities. In 2024, the number of active positions is estimated at approximately **6,700** — the difference is explained by positions not filled within the mandatory 6-month deadline imposed since 2015.

## History and competence transfer

The ACS scheme has existed since **1987**, originally created to combat Brussels unemployment. The **6th State Reform** (2014) transferred employment competence — including ACS — from the federal to the regional level, giving the Brussels-Capital Region full responsibility.

Unlike Flanders (which transformed APE/ACS into a "Vlaamse Ondersteuningspremie" system) and Wallonia (APE reform completed in 2022), **Brussels has not yet completed its reform**. The scheme has since operated under a transitional regime.

## The 2015 reform: shift towards activation

In **March 2015**, the Brussels government launched a major reform through Actiris. Key measures:

- **Elimination of 100% ministerial exemptions** for subsidies
- **6-month deadline** to fill vacant positions (non-extendable, position lost thereafter)
- **Elimination of advance payments** for new hires after 1 March 2015
- **Systematic evaluation** of all positions: 351 non-profits classified as "high risk"
- **Restriction of diploma derogations**: upward derogations (allowing overqualified candidates) progressively abolished to refocus on low-skilled target groups

This shift marks a **philosophical change**: ACS moves from structural support for the social sector to an **activation policy for the unemployed**, where the position should serve as a stepping stone to sustainable employment. The non-profit sector criticises this shift: ACS positions often fulfil permanent and essential functions (home care, childcare, social cohesion) incompatible with a "stepping stone" logic.

## The ACS differential: structural underfunding

The core problem identified by BRUXEO (non-profit employers' federation) is the **"ACS differential"**: employers must offer ACS workers the same salaries and conditions as regular staff, but the regional premium does not cover the full cost.

Three factors widen this gap:

1. **Non-profit agreements** (COCOF/COCOM) provide higher salary scales than those recognised by the ACS premium
2. The premium only accounts for **ACS seniority**, not prior sector experience
3. **New benefits** (additional leave days, bonuses) apply to ACS workers **without supplementary budget**

Employers therefore absorb the difference, which weakens the smallest and most subsidy-dependent organisations.

## Non-profit mobilisation (February 2026)

On **3 February 2026**, hundreds of non-profit sector workers demonstrated outside 16 rue de la Loi in Brussels, demanding a **sectoral social agreement** and immediate investment. The unions (CNE, CGSLB, FGTB) denounce:

- The deterioration of working conditions in essential sectors (care, social work, childcare)
- The freeze on subsidised employment for nearly 20 years (no new ACS positions since 2007)
- The announced postponement of a social agreement to **2028**, deemed unacceptable

A **national demonstration** was announced for **12 March 2026**.

## RPD 2026: what prospects?

The Regional Policy Declaration of 13 February 2026 mentions the "**continuation of ACS reform**". The dossier is linked to other employment commitments (70% employment rate target, enhanced activation, bilingualism). The split of Employment/Training competences between two different ministers at COCOF (Hublet for Employment, Dilliès for Training) complicates coordination.

## Issues to watch

- **Non-profit social agreement**: will an agreement be reached before 2028, as unions demand?
- **ACS differential**: will the Region increase premiums to bridge the salary gap?
- **Position creation**: will the freeze in place since 2007 be lifted to meet growing needs (home care, childcare, social cohesion)?
- **Employment/Training coordination**: will the COCOF split between Hublet and Dilliès allow coherent management of Actiris and Bruxelles Formation?
- **Unemployment reform impact**: the expected 42,000 exclusions will increase pressure on the non-profit sector (CPAS, social services), which already lacks resources
