## How it works

At the Brussels regional level, the formation of a government follows a different process from the federal level. **There is no royal intervention**: the Brussels Parliament manages the formation itself. A party leader or political figure typically takes the initiative to explore coalition possibilities.

The typical process:

1. **Exploratory phase** — informal contacts between party leaders to identify possible configurations
2. **Appointment of a formateur** — Parliament tasks a person with negotiating an agreement
3. **Policy negotiation** — the parties negotiate the content of the government programme
4. **Portfolio allocation** — who gets which ministry
5. **Vote of confidence** — Parliament votes its confidence in the new government

## Why this is the most likely scenario

Historically, Belgium always ends up forming a classical government, even if it takes time. At the federal level:

- **2010-2011**: 541 days -> Di Rupo government (compromise on the splitting of BHV)
- **2019-2020**: 494 days -> De Croo government (triggered by the COVID crisis)

At the Brussels regional level, formations have always been faster than at the federal level, because the number of parties is more limited and the institutional (community-related) stakes are less weighty.

## Current obstacles

Without going into the details of party positions (that is not BGM's role), the structural obstacles identified in the press and academic analyses are:

- Political fragmentation following the 2024 elections
- Disagreements over budgetary priorities
- Institutional questions related to Brussels governance

## Legal basis

The Special Act on Institutional Reforms of 12 January 1989, which governs Brussels institutions, **sets no deadline** for government formation. There is no automatic mechanism that would force a formation (unlike some countries where new elections are triggered automatically after a certain period).

The outgoing government remains in office in a "caretaker" capacity for as long as necessary — that is, until a new government is sworn in.
