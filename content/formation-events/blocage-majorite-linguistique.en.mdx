## What happened

On 15 December 2024, after several months of negotiations, the formateur officially acknowledged that the Arizona coalition (MR-Les Engages-CD&V-Vooruit) did not command a majority in the Dutch-speaking linguistic group of the Brussels Parliament.

## The structural obstacle

In the Brussels Parliament, a government must obtain the confidence of a majority of the assembly, but a political convention also requires sufficient support within each linguistic group. With only CD&V and Vooruit on the Dutch-speaking side, the Arizona coalition did not assemble enough seats in that group, as some members of these parties had also indicated their refusal to support the formula.

## The consequences

This arithmetical deadlock marked a turning point in the formation process. It demonstrated that:

1. A coalition viable at the federal level is not necessarily viable at the Brussels level
2. The specific configuration of the Brussels Parliament, with its linguistic groups, imposes additional constraints
3. An alternative formula, including other Dutch-speaking or French-speaking parties, would need to be explored

The formateur did not resign immediately, but the negotiation dynamic was broken.
