The data come from the EU-SILC survey harmonised by Eurostat, available at NUTS-2 level for capital-city regions. This comparison uses the most recent available data (2023)."

caveat: "The overburden rate includes both tenants and homeowners with mortgages, but tenure structures vary significantly between regions (high proportion of tenants in Berlin and Brussels, more homeowners in Île-de-France). Housing costs include utilities and maintenance, but their exact scope may vary between national surveys. Regional NUTS-2 data may be affected by smaller sample sizes than national data."

## Context

The housing cost overburden rate is a key indicator of the financial pressure exerted on households by the housing market. Defined by Eurostat as the share of the population whose housing expenditure exceeds 40% of disposable income, it enables an objective comparison of European capital-city regions. The data come from the EU-SILC survey, harmonised at NUTS-2 level.

## The data compared

Among the six capital-city regions selected, Hovedstaden (Copenhagen) records the highest rate (18.1%), reflecting the high cost of living in Scandinavian capitals. Berlin follows closely (16.4%), a consequence of rapid rent increases in the German capital over the past decade. Brussels-Capital stands at 14.8%, a level significantly above the Belgian national average of approximately 7.7%. Île-de-France (11.6%) and Zuid-Holland (9.2%) occupy intermediate positions. Wien stands out with the lowest rate (7.3%), thanks in particular to its historic social housing stock (Gemeindebau), which provides affordable options for a large share of the population.

## The Brussels case

The Brussels overburden rate (14.8%) is nearly double the Belgian national average. This situation is explained by the combination of high rents in a dense urban region and median incomes lower than those of other European capitals. The high proportion of tenants (approximately 60% of households) exposes a significant share of the population to rental market fluctuations.

The absence of a fully empowered regional government since June 2024 compounds this situation: the Housing Fund has suspended the granting of new social mortgage credits, over 62,000 households are on the social housing waiting list, and no new housing affordability programmes have been launched. Unlike Wien, where authorities actively invest in social housing through multi-year programmes, the Brussels-Capital Region currently lacks the decision-making capacity to initiate new support measures.
