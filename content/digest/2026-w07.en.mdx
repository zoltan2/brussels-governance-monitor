## Brussels government agreement validated

The week was marked by the definitive validation of the Brussels government agreement by the seven coalition parties. After 613 days without a fully empowered regional government, party congresses approved the negotiated text.

The seven coalition parties each held their validation congress between 12 and 13 February. The agreement provides for a return to budgetary balance by 2029 and covers the ten domains monitored by the Brussels Governance Monitor.

**What this changes:** the Brussels-Capital Region now has a stable parliamentary majority and a legislative programme. Blocked dossiers (SLRB, Vivaqua, Security Plan) can be relaunched.

The agreement sets the objective of returning to budgetary balance by 2029, through 80% spending cuts and 20% new revenue. The current deficit is estimated at ~€1.2 billion.
