## What happened

On 5 February 2026, the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region voted a new provisional twelfths ordinance for the first quarter of 2026. This vote marks a dismal record: the Region enters its second full year without a budget adopted by a fully empowered government.

## The budgetary deterioration

After more than a year and a half of provisional twelfths, the cumulative effects have become alarming:

- **Real erosion of approximately 6%**: cumulative inflation since 2024 has reduced the real value of authorised expenditure by that much
- **Frozen investments**: no new investment project has been launched since the June 2024 elections
- **Expired agreements**: numerous agreements between the Region and subsidised bodies have expired without being renewed
- **Services under strain**: several regional administrations report operational difficulties linked to budgetary constraints

## The Court of Audit warning

The Court of Audit accompanies this vote with a public warning on the regional financial situation. The report highlights:

- The risk of a downgrade in the Region's credit rating
- The accumulation of deferred expenditure that will create a "budget wall" when normal budgeting resumes
- The impact on the Region's borrowing capacity

## Budgetary pressure as leverage

Paradoxically, this vote reinforces the momentum in favour of a swift solution. The budgetary deterioration is no longer an abstract concept: it translates concretely into the daily functioning of public services. This financial pressure, combined with citizen and parliamentary pressure, creates an unprecedented sense of urgency.
