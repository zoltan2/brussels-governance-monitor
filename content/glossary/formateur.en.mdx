The formateur is the person appointed to form a new government. Their mission is to negotiate a government agreement between the parties likely to form a coalition, then to propose the composition of the ministerial team. This appointment generally follows the information phase led by an informateur.

At the level of the Brussels-Capital Region, the formation process has specificities linked to the need to respect linguistic balances between French-speakers and Dutch-speakers. The regional government must include ministers from both linguistic groups, which adds complexity to the negotiations.

The duration of the formateur's mission is not limited and can extend over several months. In case of failure, a new formateur or an informateur may be appointed to restart the process. Each formation attempt is what the Brussels Governance Monitor calls a Round.
