## Coalition Agreement: Announced Commitments
The agreement of 12 February 2026 announces a massive unlocking for the housing sector:

- **SLRB**: injection of **EUR 400 million**
- **1,000+ public housing units** over the parliamentary term
- **Be Home doubled**: 160 → **EUR 320/month**
- **Renolution replaced** by **zero-interest loans** (EUR 200 million until 2029)
- **Neo (Heysel)**: relaunched
- **Brownfield sites arbitrated**: Wiels/Ajvil/Donderberg preserved, 18-month moratorium on Keyenbempt/Calevoet/Josaphat/Meylemeersch, Chant des Cailles + Dames Blanches confirmed

These commitments, if implemented, represent the largest investment in social housing in a decade. The 62,234 households waiting and the stock of 42,000 social housing units remain the baseline context.

## Post-agreement developments (February 2026)

### SLRB: EUR 197 million in debt

The SLRB has accumulated a **debt of EUR 197 million** owed to the Brussels Region. In December 2025, an agreement was reached to spread repayment over several years. But two immediate consequences:

- **Sale of the Ariane site** (Woluwe-Saint-Lambert, currently a Fedasil centre) — estimated at ~EUR 30M
- **Sale of the Palais site** (Schaerbeek) — estimated at ~EUR 22-23M

These two sites were earmarked for conversion into social housing. Their sale represents **EUR 52-53 million** but worsens the shortage of available land for the 62,234 households on the waiting list.

In total, the SLRB must dispose of **EUR 73 million in assets** from 2026 onward, including the conversion of social rental housing into social home-ownership units.

### Reference rent reform

The new government is introducing a system of **voluntary conventioning**: landlords who apply the reference rent receive incentives. The **Be Home allowance** is doubled from 160 to **EUR 320/month** for participating landlords.

The reference rent grid, based on 2017-2020 data, will be **updated in 2026**.

### Reform timeline

- **15 March 2026**: principles of the structural reform of social housing financing
- **31 May 2026**: full reform adopted
- **1 January 2027**: entry into force
