methodology: "Comparison of regional unemployment rates (population aged 15-74) at NUTS-2 level, based on the Labour Force Survey (LFS) harmonised by Eurostat. The data cover the capital-city regions of five selected countries. Comparability is ensured by the common LFS methodological framework, but labour market structures (public employment, industrial fabric, seasonality) differ significantly between regions."

caveat: "NUTS-2 boundaries do not always correspond to actual employment basins. Brussels-Capital (BE10) is a compact region of 161 km² that excludes its functional urban area, unlike Île-de-France (12,012 km²) or Noord-Holland (2,670 km²). The Brussels unemployment rate is also influenced by specific structural factors: linguistic mismatch between labour supply and demand, concentration of low-skilled populations in the urban core, and competition from Flemish and Walloon commuters for local jobs."

## Context

The unemployment rate is one of the most closely watched indicators for assessing a region's economic health. Within the European Union, Eurostat harmonises data through the Labour Force Survey (LFS), enabling comparison at NUTS-2 level — the statistical tier that generally corresponds to capital-city regions.

## The data compared

Among the five capital regions selected, the Brussels-Capital Region has the highest unemployment rate at 12.7% as of end-2024. This rate is approximately 1.5 times higher than Wien (7.8%) and Berlin (8.6%), and more than three times higher than Noord-Holland (3.6%).

Île-de-France, despite a population of over 12 million, maintains a relatively low rate (7.3%), partly due to the diversity of its economic fabric and the inclusion of suburban zones within its NUTS-2 perimeter.

## The Brussels case

The Brussels-Capital Region's high unemployment rate is explained by a combination of structural factors:

- **Linguistic mismatch**: many job offers require French-Dutch bilingualism, while a significant share of Brussels jobseekers are francophone or allophone.
- **Commuter effect**: approximately 360,000 people work in Brussels without residing there, occupying a significant share of skilled jobs.
- **Urban concentration**: the Region's geographic compactness (19 municipalities, 161 km²) concentrates low-skilled populations without the dilution effect of larger NUTS-2 regions.
- **Governance crisis**: the absence of a fully empowered government since June 2024 freezes active employment policies and training investments.

## Limitations of the comparison

The NUTS-2 nomenclature produces highly heterogeneous geographic units. Brussels-Capital is one of the EU's smallest NUTS-2 regions, while Île-de-France or Noord-Holland encompass far larger territories including rural and peri-urban areas. This difference in perimeter mechanically affects socio-economic indicators.
