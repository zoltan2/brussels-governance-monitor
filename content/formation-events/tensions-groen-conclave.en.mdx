## What happened

The first day of the conclave, 10 February 2026, was marked by a **gradual escalation of tensions**, primarily around Groen. The day followed a tension curve: calm in the morning, increasingly tense in the afternoon, peak of anger in the evening.

## The budgetary friction point

The budgetary trajectory demanded by Anders as a prerequisite requires a return to balance by 2029, amounting to roughly **EUR 1 billion in savings over three years** (~EUR 350 million per year). Groen contests this trajectory, claiming never to have agreed to it. According to internal negotiation sources: "Groen is isolated. They reject budgetary balance, saying they never signed up for this."

## The mobility conflict

A second front opened over mobility policy. The draft regional policy declaration would **immediately abandon the Good Move plan** — the flagship mobility plan of the previous legislature, championed by Groen. This measure appeared at the opening of the mobility chapter, which was perceived as a provocation by the Groen delegation.

Additionally, an MR proposal to **drastically reduce low emission zone (LEZ) fines** was expected to be voted on Wednesday, with anticipated PS support — further marginalising Groen's environmental priorities.

## Reactions

The Groen delegation leader was described as "not constructive" by several conclave participants. For her part, she had warned on 9 February that she could not "comment on substance" without prior access to texts, tables and agendas — implying that agreements had been reached between MR and PS ahead of the conclave.

## What is at stake

Without Groen, the 7-party coalition loses its **double linguistic majority** on the Dutch-speaking side. The party is arithmetically necessary for the formation. Groen's isolation puts the conclave at risk of deadlock from its very first day.
