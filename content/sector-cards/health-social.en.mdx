## Government agreement: announced impacts

According to concordant press sources, the agreement of 12 February 2026 includes several measures that affect the bi-communal health and social sector:

- **Administrative reform (merger of pillars)**: the merger of 25 regional bodies into 3 to 4 entities could affect the governance of COCOM and Iriscare. The precise terms are not yet known
- **Regional drugs commissioner**: this new role, announced under the security chapter, intersects with COCOM's competences in harm reduction and addiction care
- **Budgetary effort**: the trajectory to return to balance by 2029 implies an expenditure review that also concerns COCOM's budgets, which are already operating on provisional twelfths

**Key consideration**: the end of the caretaker period makes it possible to unblock accreditations, Iriscare agreements and the structural plan to combat homelessness. The scale of this relaunch will depend on upcoming budgetary arbitrations.
