The Flemish Community Commission (Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie, VGC) is the Brussels institution responsible for Dutch-speaking matters in the Brussels-Capital Region. It operates in the areas of culture, education, social assistance and welfare for the Dutch-speaking Brussels community.

Unlike the COCOF, the VGC does not have its own decree-making power. It works through regulations and remains more closely linked to the Flemish government, which directly exercises certain community competences in Brussels. Its assembly is composed of the 17 Dutch-speaking members of the Brussels Parliament.

The VGC plays an important role for the Dutch-speaking community in Brussels by supporting schools, cultural centres and social services. During a regional formation crisis, it continues to function normally as its bodies are distinct from the regional government, although the mandates are partially linked.
