## What happened

On 30 January 2026, ten days after the resignation of the formateur (5th round), between **600 and 800 Brussels residents** gathered at Place de la Bourse from 7 pm to protest 600 days without a regional government. The rally was organised by two citizen collectives: **Respect Brussels** and **We Are Brussels**.

## The context

The rally took place on the very day the fifth formation round officially ended in failure. Citizens expressed their exasperation with:

- The Region had been in caretaker mode for over 600 days
- Five formation attempts had failed
- Public services were showing signs of deterioration
- The regional budget had been running on provisional twelfths for over a year

## The demands

The demonstrators carried simple, cross-community demands:

- **"Ca suffit!" (Enough!)**: an end to interminable negotiations
- **"Politicians, put your ego in the freezer"**: a call to transcend partisan blockages
- **"Out of the sandbox, recess is over"**: a call for political accountability

## The significance

This demonstration, though modest in size, marked a turning point in the crisis. For the first time, the formation of a regional government became a citizen cause bringing people to the streets. The rally directly catalysed the initiative by Respect Brussels which, two days later (1 February), brought representatives of all 11 Brussels parties around the same table -- a historic first.
