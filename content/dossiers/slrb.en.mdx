## Background

The SLRB coordinates social housing policy in the Brussels Region. It oversees 16 Sociétés Immobilières de Service Public (SISP) that directly manage the housing stock. With over 50,000 households on the waiting list, social housing in Brussels is under structural pressure.

The existing stock requires major renovation work — thermal insulation, compliance upgrades, and heavy renovation of dilapidated buildings. These investments require multi-year budget commitments that only a fully empowered government can authorise.

## Impact of the Crisis

The absence of a regional government prevents:

- The adoption of a new multi-year renovation plan
- Funding for new construction projects
- Arbitrations between renovating the existing stock and building new housing
- Implementation of an updated allocation policy

The SISPs continue to handle day-to-day management (maintenance, allocation according to existing lists), but all structural investment is frozen.

## Key Issues

- **Social**: housing is the largest expenditure item for low-income Brussels households; the lack of a structural response deepens precarity
- **Energy**: a large proportion of the housing stock is energy-inefficient; renovation delays increase tenants' utility costs
- **Urban planning**: several new housing projects are ready on paper but cannot be launched
