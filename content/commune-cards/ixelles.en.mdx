## A cosmopolitan municipality in the heart of Brussels

Ixelles is the fourth most populated municipality in the Brussels Region with nearly 90,000 inhabitants. A major student and nightlife district, it hosts the ULB and a vibrant cultural scene. Since the 2024 elections, a mirror coalition of PS-MR-Engagés governs the municipality.

## Transparency: 4 out of 6 criteria

Ixelles meets four of the six BGM monitoring criteria. The **budget** is published online, the council is broadcast via **livestream** on YouTube, the **mandate registry** is available, and the municipality runs a **participatory budget** of EUR 170,000. Council **minutes** are classified as "partial" (agendas published, but no dedicated full minutes section). No dedicated **Open Data** portal.

## Citizen participation: participatory budget

Ixelles organises an annual participatory budget of **EUR 170,000** allowing citizens to submit and vote on projects. Submission runs from October to December, voting from February to March.
