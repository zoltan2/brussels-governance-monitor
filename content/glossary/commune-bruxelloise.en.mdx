The Brussels-Capital Region is composed of 19 municipalities: Anderlecht, Auderghem, Berchem-Sainte-Agathe, the City of Brussels, Etterbeek, Evere, Forest, Ganshoren, Ixelles, Jette, Koekelberg, Molenbeek-Saint-Jean, Saint-Gilles, Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, Schaerbeek, Uccle, Watermael-Boitsfort, Woluwe-Saint-Lambert and Woluwe-Saint-Pierre.

Each municipality has a directly elected municipal council and a college of the mayor and aldermen. Their competences cover local urban planning, civil registry, management of municipal roads, municipal education, administrative policing and management of the social welfare centre (CPAS). They are funded through regional grants, municipal taxes and shares of personal income tax.

During a regional formation crisis, the municipalities continue to function normally as they have their own elected bodies and their own administration. However, they suffer the indirect consequences of the crisis: frozen regional grants, no new regional investments and difficulty obtaining decisions on inter-municipal projects.
