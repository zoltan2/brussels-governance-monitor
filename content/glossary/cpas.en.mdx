The Public Centre for Social Welfare (CPAS in French, OCMW in Dutch) is a public body present in each of the 19 Brussels municipalities. Its mission is to guarantee the right to social assistance for any person in need. Each CPAS is led by a social action council and a president, and has its own staff and budget. Its main missions include granting the social integration income, urgent medical aid, housing assistance, socio-professional integration and reception of asylum seekers.

In Brussels, the CPAS face particularly significant challenges due to the concentration of vulnerable populations in the capital Region. The rate of integration income recipients is significantly higher than in the rest of the country. Brussels CPAS are funded by the municipalities, by federal subsidies and by COCOM for certain bi-community matters.

During a regional formation crisis, the CPAS continue to operate as they depend on the municipalities and not on the regional government. However, they bear the full brunt of the social consequences of the crisis: rising demand for social assistance without additional resources, frozen integration projects managed by the Region, and difficulty meeting growing needs with constrained budgets.
