## What happened

On 21 January 2026, the formateur from Les Engages officially submitted a letter of resignation to the President of the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region. This resignation formalised the failure of the fifth formation round, the most advanced since the elections of 9 June 2024.

## The context of the resignation

The six-party "Guinness" coalition had produced a nearly complete government programme. Programmatic negotiations had reached agreement on the main dossiers: housing, mobility, multi-year budget. However, a key Dutch-speaking partner refused at the last moment to commit, citing insufficient guarantees in regional governance.

## The consequences

The formateur's resignation marked a turning point:

- **Exhaustion of classical formulas**: five formation rounds had failed, exhausting all reasonable political configurations
- **Citizen catalyst**: the news triggered unprecedented mobilisation in Brussels civil society
- **Institutional vacuum**: no new formateur or informateur was immediately designated, leaving the Region in a political no man's land
