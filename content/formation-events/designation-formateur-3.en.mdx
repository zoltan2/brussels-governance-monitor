## What happened

On 15 November 2025, the Brussels Parliament designated a third formateur, from Les Engages. This party, present in virtually every coalition configuration considered since the start of the crisis, was deemed best placed to attempt a final synthesis.

## The choice of Les Engages

The choice of a formateur from Les Engages was explained by the party's pivotal position:
- Present in the Arizona formula (round 1)
- Co-responsible for the successful information phase (round 2)
- Partner in the progressive coalition (rounds 3 and 5)

Les Engages is the only French-speaking party that actively participated in every formation attempt, giving it an in-depth knowledge of all positions.

## The mandate

The formateur received an ambitious mandate: to form a government before the end of 2025. The pressure was at its peak: the Region was approaching 18 months in caretaker mode, the budgetary situation was deteriorating and public opinion was increasingly critical.

The formateur immediately announced an intensive working method, with continuous negotiation sessions and deadlines imposed on the parties.
