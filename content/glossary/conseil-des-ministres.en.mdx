The Council of Ministers is the collegial body within which the Brussels regional government deliberates and takes decisions. It brings together the Minister-President and the four regional ministers. Decisions are taken by consensus or, failing that, by majority vote. The principle of collegiality means that each minister is collectively responsible for the decisions taken.

The Council of Ministers meets regularly to handle dossiers within regional competences: approval of draft ordinances, budgetary decisions, appointments, public procurement and general policy orientations. Deliberations are confidential, but decisions are published and notified to the relevant bodies.

Under a caretaker government, the Council of Ministers continues to meet but its agenda is strictly limited to urgent and ongoing matters. It cannot approve major new policy projects, which considerably reduces the Region's governance capacity. This limitation is one of the most direct manifestations of the formation crisis on institutional functioning.
