The administrative pillars reform is the most ambitious restructuring in the history of Brussels regional administration. Set out in chapter 4 of the DPR of February 2026, it aims to merge 25 regional bodies into 4 major pillars, targeting savings of 20 to 30% on operating costs.

Pillars 1 (shared support: HR, IT, finance) and 2 (core missions: mobility, housing, environment) are to be operational from 2026. Pillar 3 (infrastructure.brussels, a new public-law corporation) is planned for 2027. This reform potentially impacts all sectors, from non-profit accreditations to employment policy.
