The SLRB (Société du Logement de la Région de Bruxelles-Capitale), known in Dutch as the BGHM (Brusselse Gewestelijke Huisvestingsmaatschappij), is the public body that coordinates social housing policy in the Brussels-Capital Region. It oversees the 16 Public Real Estate Companies (SISP) that directly manage social housing units.

The February 2026 government agreement provides for the financial consolidation of the SLRB and a programme of over 1,000 public housing units during the legislative term, with an envelope of EUR 400 million.
