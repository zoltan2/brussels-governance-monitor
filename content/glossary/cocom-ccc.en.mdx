The Common Community Commission (COCOM or CCC; in Dutch: Gemeenschappelijke Gemeenschapscommissie — GGC) is the Brussels institution that manages bi-community matters: competences related to individuals (health, social welfare, disability policy, elderly care) that serve all Brussels residents without linguistic distinction.

The COCOM is led by the United College, composed of the same ministers as the Brussels regional government. Its assembly is the United Assembly, composed of the same members of parliament as the Brussels Parliament. The COCOM thus functions as a mirror of the Region, but for different competences.

In the context of the formation crisis, the absence of a regional government also means the absence of the United College of the COCOM. Bi-community investments in health and social welfare are therefore frozen, directly affecting care institutions, public welfare centres (CPAS) and policies for the homeless.

The public interest body Iriscare, created in 2019, manages the COCOM budgets but cannot launch new initiatives without a political decision from the United College.
