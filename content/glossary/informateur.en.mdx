The informateur is a political figure appointed in the initial phase following elections or a government crisis. Their mission is to consult the various political parties, identify points of convergence and divergence, and assess which coalitions are feasible. At the end of their mission, the informateur submits a report and recommends a formation path.

This stage is crucial as it clears the ground before a formateur is appointed. The informateur does not have a mandate to negotiate a government agreement: their work is purely exploratory. In the Brussels context, this phase must take into account the institutional complexity of the Region, notably the coexistence of the linguistic groups.

When the informateur's consultations fail or do not lead to a viable path, a new informateur may be appointed. The Brussels Governance Monitor tracks these different phases through the concept of a Round, with each new attempt constituting a distinct Round.
