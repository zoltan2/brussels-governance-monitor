The Low Emission Zone (LEZ) has been in force in Brussels since 2018. It progressively bans the most polluting vehicles based on their Euro emission standard. Non-compliant vehicles receive a fine when an infraction is detected by ANPR cameras.

The government agreement of February 2026 maintains the LEZ but introduces an **annual pass** (EUR 350, social rate EUR 200) as a legal alternative to per-infraction fines. The per-infraction fine is reduced to EUR 80 and the cap of 4 fines per year is abolished.
