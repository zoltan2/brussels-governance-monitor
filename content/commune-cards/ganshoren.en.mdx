## A small municipality with good practices

Ganshoren is a small municipality of 25,500 inhabitants led by Jean-Paul Van Laethem (Les Engagés) in coalition with the PS. Despite its modest size, it achieves a good transparency score.

## Transparency: 5 out of 6 criteria

The **budget** and council **minutes** (dedicated page with agendas) are published online, the council is broadcast via **livestream** (YouTube and social media since 2020), the **mandate registry** is accessible, and the municipality uses **Fluicity** for **citizen participation** with a participatory budget. No **Open Data** portal.

## Citizen participation: Fluicity

Ganshoren launched its citizen participation platform via **Fluicity**, including a participatory budget allowing residents to propose and vote on municipal projects.
