## Background

Bruxelles Prévention & Sécurité (BPS) is the regional body responsible for coordinating security and prevention policy in Brussels. It works in conjunction with the six Brussels police zones and the 19 communes.

The regional security plan sets out the priorities, resources, and coordination between the various stakeholders. The previous plan has reached its expiry and was due for renewal by the new government following the 2024 elections.

## Impact of the Crisis

The absence of a government prevents:

- The adoption of a new regional security plan
- The definition of new prevention priorities
- Funding for new prevention programmes
- Updated coordination between police zones and communes

Existing measures continue to operate, but without a renewed strategic framework.

## Key Issues

- **Prevention**: security challenges are evolving (cybercrime, radicalisation, urban violence) and require an updated regional framework
- **Coordination**: Brussels has 6 police zones and 19 communes; regional coordination is essential for a coherent policy
- **Funding**: certain prevention programmes are reaching their expiry and cannot be renewed without a political decision
