A special law (French: loi speciale) is a particular category of Belgian federal law that requires, for its adoption, a reinforced majority in the federal Parliament: a two-thirds majority of all votes cast, with additionally a majority in each of the linguistic groups (French-speaking and Dutch-speaking). This mechanism ensures that no linguistic community can be outvoted on fundamental issues.

Special laws form the legal foundation of Belgium's institutional architecture. They define the competences of the Regions and Communities, organise the functioning of the institutions (including the Brussels-Capital Region) and establish linguistic minority protection mechanisms. The Special Law of 12 January 1989 is the founding act of the Brussels Region.

Any modification to the Brussels institutional framework requires the adoption of a special law at the federal level. This means that institutional reforms of the Region depend not only on the political will of Brussels, but also on the capacity to assemble the required majorities in the federal Parliament, adding an additional layer of complexity to the governance of Brussels.
