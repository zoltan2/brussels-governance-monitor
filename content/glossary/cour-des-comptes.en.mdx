The Court of Audit (French: Cour des comptes) is an independent constitutional institution responsible for the external audit of public finances in Belgium. It assists legislative assemblies, including the Brussels Parliament, in exercising oversight of public expenditure. Its missions include verifying the legality and regularity of revenue and expenditure, as well as evaluating the proper use of public funds.

In the Brussels context, the Court of Audit plays an essential role by regularly publishing reports on the Region's financial management. Its analyses focus notably on the regional budget, the accounts of public bodies and major investment projects such as Metro 3. These reports constitute reliable and independent sources of information.

During a political crisis and a period of provisional twelfths, the Court of Audit's reports become all the more important as they are sometimes the only documents offering a clear picture of the state of regional finances. The Brussels Governance Monitor relies on these reports as official sources to document the budgetary impact of the formation crisis.
