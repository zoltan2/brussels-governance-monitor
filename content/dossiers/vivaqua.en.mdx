## Government agreement: what changes

The agreement of 12 February 2026 provides for the **financial consolidation of Vivaqua**. This measure is part of the coalition's structural commitments, alongside the consolidation of the SLRB. The exact modalities (recapitalisation, regional guarantee, debt restructuring) are not yet known.

The end of the caretaker period unblocks the multi-year investment plan and tariff decisions that had been pending since June 2024.

## Inherited context

Vivaqua is the Brussels intermunicipal utility responsible for the production and distribution of drinking water as well as wastewater collection. Its pipeline network, spanning over 4,200 km, is largely outdated — some pipes date back to the 19th century.

The operator had developed an ambitious multi-year investment plan to progressively renew the network, improve resilience against extreme weather events, and reduce water losses.

## What was blocked (June 2024 — February 2026)

- Approval of the multi-year investment plan
- Tariff increases needed to fund the works
- Priority arbitrations between network renewal and new infrastructure
- Regional guarantees on Vivaqua's borrowings

Routine maintenance continued, but renewal investments were deferred, worsening the network's deterioration.

## Issues to monitor

- **Public health**: an ageing network increases the risk of contamination
- **Water losses**: network leaks represent a significant waste of the resource
- **Climate resilience**: stormwater drainage infrastructure is undersized for the increasingly frequent episodes of heavy rainfall
- **Tariffs**: financial consolidation could entail tariff adjustments for consumers
