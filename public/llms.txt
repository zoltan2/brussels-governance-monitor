# Brussels Governance Monitor (BGM)

> Independent, non-partisan monitoring of Brussels regional governance.

## About

Brussels Governance Monitor (BGM) is a citizen-led, data-driven platform that documents the governance of the Brussels-Capital Region (Belgium). It tracks government commitments, key policy dossiers, budgets, and public data — domain by domain, metric by metric, source by source.

## What BGM covers

- 13 policy domains (budget, mobility, employment, housing, climate, social, security, economy, cleanliness, institutional, urban planning, digital, education)
- 16 key dossiers (Good Move, LEZ, Metro 3, SLRB, Vivaqua, PFAS, ACS, and more)
- 11 economic sectors impacted by governance decisions
- 19 Brussels municipalities with transparency scores
- Government composition and DPR (regional policy declaration) commitments
- 290+ verified sources with confidence levels (official, estimated, unconfirmed)

## Content structure

Each topic is documented as a "card" with:
- Factual summary and detailed analysis
- Key metrics with source, date, and confidence level
- Status (ongoing, delayed, blocked, resolved)
- Links to related domains, sectors, dossiers, and communes
- Full source list with access dates

## Methodology

BGM follows strict editorial rules:
- Every fact must have an identifiable, dated source
- No editorializing, no political judgment, no politician names in analysis cards
- Three confidence levels: official (institutional source), estimated (documented calculation), unconfirmed (press only)
- Verification protocol with four outcomes: V1 (no change), V2 (factual change), V3 (uncertainty), V4 (suspension)
- Corrections policy: minor (silent, Git-tracked), substantial (documented in card), retraction (explicit)
