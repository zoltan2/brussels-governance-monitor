## Background

Good Move is the regional mobility plan adopted by the Brussels government in 2020. It aims to reorganise traffic in Brussels neighbourhoods through "neighbourhood cells" (low-traffic zones), the expansion of the cycling network, improvements to public transport, and a reduction in the space allocated to cars in the city.

The plan has sparked controversy in several communes, with local opposition to the implementation of neighbourhood cells.

## Impact of the Crisis

The absence of a regional government blocks:

- Decisions on priority neighbourhoods for the next cells
- Investments in associated cycling infrastructure and public transport
- Regional coordination with communes that contest the plan
- The official evaluation of cells already deployed

Some communes continue to apply cells already in place, but no new regional rollout can be decided.

## Key Issues

- **Road safety**: Brussels remains one of Belgium's most dangerous cities for pedestrians and cyclists
- **Air quality**: reducing through-traffic in neighbourhoods is a key lever for public health
- **Coherence**: the lack of regional coordination risks creating a patchwork of municipal policies
