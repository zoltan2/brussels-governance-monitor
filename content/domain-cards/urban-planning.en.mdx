## RPD commitments

The Regional Policy Declaration devotes a significant section to urban planning and spatial development, with several structural reforms:

### Faster permits

- **Shorter processing times** for urban planning permits — target to halve the approval period
- **Simplified procedures** for housing projects and energy renovations
- **Full digitalisation** of the application process via urban.brussels
- **Fast-Track single window** for the Urban Free Zones (Port of Brussels + Audi Forest site): centralised permit applications (planning, environment, aid) through a single entry point

### Planning amnesty

- **Regularisation of historic violations** — compliance mechanism for situations predating a cut-off date
- **Objective**: reduce the backlog of infringement cases and provide legal certainty to property owners

### CRMS reform

- **Removal of the binding opinion** of the Royal Commission for Monuments and Sites, replaced by a simple advisory opinion
- **Objective**: unblock renovation projects in protected areas without eliminating heritage protection

### Major projects

- **Neo (Heysel)** — revival of the congress and entertainment project on the Heysel plateau
- **Ongoing SDPs** — continuation of Strategic Development Plans for key areas

## Key agencies

- **urban.brussels** — regional urban planning administration (permits, violations, SDPs)
- **perspective.brussels** — territorial planning and impact studies
- **BMA (Bouwmeester Maître Architecte)** — architectural quality of public projects
- **SAU (Urban Development Corporation)** — development of regional sites

## Sources and methodology

The commitments documented above come from the official RPD text and corroborating press sources covering the government agreement of 12 February 2026.
