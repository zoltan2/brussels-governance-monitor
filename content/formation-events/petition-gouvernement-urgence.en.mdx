## What happened

On 1 February 2026, a citizen collective launched a petition addressed to the Brussels Parliament calling for the establishment of a "thematic emergency government". Within days, the petition gathered a significant number of signatures, testifying to the scale of citizen frustration.

## The proposed concept

The idea of a thematic emergency government rests on a simple principle: separating concrete emergencies from the institutional questions that have blocked the formation for 19 months.

The collective proposed:

- **A government with a limited mandate**: focused on three to five urgent themes (budget, housing, mobility, employment)
- **A fixed term**: a one-year mandate, renewable once
- **No institutional package deal**: linguistic governance questions would be addressed separately, through a dedicated process
- **Reduced composition**: a minimal number of ministers, chosen for their competence in the urgent areas

## The reactions

The petition prompted contrasting reactions:

- **Massive citizen support**: the number of signatures testified to broad backing for the idea of breaking with the classical framework
- **Interest from certain parliamentarians**: members from different parties declared themselves open to exploring this avenue
- **Legal reservations**: constitutional law experts noted that the current legal framework does not explicitly provide for a "limited-mandate emergency government"

## The significance

Beyond its immediate impact, this petition changed the terms of the debate. It introduced the idea that a government need not resolve all problems at once to be legitimate and useful.
