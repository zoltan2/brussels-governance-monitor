## Coalition Agreement: Announced Commitments

> **Note**: The official text of the Regional Policy Declaration (DPR) has not yet been published. The measures below are based on concordant press sources (RTBF, La Libre, DH, BX1, VRT NWS, BRUZZ). They will be updated once the official document is available.

According to concordant press sources, the agreement of 12 February 2026 announces ambitious employment targets:

- **Target: 70% employment rate** by the end of the parliamentary term (vs 64.9% currently)
- **Enhanced activation** of jobseekers
- **Mandatory skills assessment** for all jobseekers
- **Language assessment** upon registration, mandatory FR/NL training if skills are absent
- **Promotion of bilingualism** as a lever for employment access

These announced measures would respond to the double crisis documented below: the federal unemployment reform (42,000 exclusions) and the structural rise in Brussels unemployment (98,458 jobseekers in January 2026). The gap between the 70% target and the current 64.9% level represents a required gain of more than 5 points within one parliamentary term.

The following sections document the inherited situation and contextual data.

## The double crisis

Brussels faces an unprecedented situation: the largest federal unemployment reform in decades arrives at the precise moment when the Region is unable to deploy a structural political response.

### Brussels, last in employment in Belgium

The Labour Force Survey figures (Statbel, Q3 2025) confirm the scale of the structural gap:

- **Unemployment rate (ILO)**: 13.1% in Brussels, compared to 7.9% in Wallonia and **4.5% in Flanders**. The Region has an unemployment rate **twice as high** as the national average (6.5%).
- **Employment rate (20-64)**: 64.9% in Brussels, compared to 68.6% in Wallonia and 76.5% in Flanders. This is the lowest rate of the three Regions, nearly 8 points below the national average (72.7%).

These ILO figures, based on an international methodology, are complementary to the Actiris administrative unemployment rate (15.4%). The difference is explained by the criteria: the ILO counts as unemployed any person without a job who is actively seeking work, while Actiris counts those registered as jobseekers.

### The federal unemployment reform

Since 1 January 2026, the reform adopted by the federal government limits the duration of unemployment benefits to a maximum of 24 months. The main measures:

- **Professional integration period** reduced from 12 to 6 months
- **Integration allowances** limited to 12 months (compared to 36 months previously)
- **Mass exclusion**: according to the FGTB, at least 32,000 Brussels residents were excluded from January 2026, and 42,000 over 18 months (Actiris estimate)

The most affected municipalities: Brussels-City (7,825 exclusions), Schaerbeek (4,761), Anderlecht (4,604), Molenbeek (4,048). In Saint-Josse, Molenbeek and Saint-Gilles, nearly 4% of the population is affected.

### The Region's inability to respond

In caretaker mode, the Brussels government cannot:

- Launch new structural **employment programmes**
- Create the **Employment Task Force** called for by Brupartners to mobilise all Brussels stakeholders
- Vote a **real budget** to increase resources for Actiris and Bruxelles Formation
- Adopt new **ordinances** on employment or training

## What has been done despite everything

The caretaker government adopted a 7-measure action plan in July 2025 to prepare for the reform:

1. Simplification of availability checks
2. Strengthened individual guidance
3. Generalisation of skills assessments
4. Increased orientation towards shortage occupations
5. Review of employment aid
6. Modularisation of training programmes
7. Incentives for studies in high-demand sectors

These measures, operational from 1 March 2026, represent what a caretaker government can do — but fall short of the structural response that social partners deem necessary.

### The 4th ONEM wave

In January 2026, ONEM sent **7,654 letters** (art. 63) to Brussels jobseekers, informing them of the end of their right to integration allowances on **1 July 2026**. Actiris is preparing to absorb a massive influx of re-registrations from March 2026, in anticipation of the transition.

Furthermore, reinforced control of under-25s comes into force on **1 March 2026**: young people in integration stages will need to demonstrate active job searching or face early suspension.

### January 2026: the acceleration

Actiris figures for January 2026 confirm the upward trend: **98,458 unemployed jobseekers** (DEI), a **7.3%** increase year-on-year. This is the highest figure since the end of the COVID crisis.

In parallel, bankruptcies in the Brussels Region reached **2,184 in 2025**, up **13.6%** year-on-year (source: Statbel). Nationally, **30,000 net job losses** were recorded — the highest figure in 11 years.

## Social dialogue blocked

In June 2025, marking one year without government, Brupartners identified 10 urgent measures, including an "Employment Task Force" to address the reform's impacts. Despite the 2025 Social Summit, dialogue between social partners and the government remains structurally limited: Brupartners' opinions do not find a counterpart authorised to legislate.

## What continues to function

- **Actiris**: registration, guidance, matching, monthly statistics
- **Bruxelles Formation** and **VDAB Brussel**: existing training programmes maintained
- **Integration contract**: existing programme for young people under 25
- **Youth Guarantee**: Actiris commitment to young jobseekers

## The impact on CPAS

People excluded from unemployment benefits will turn to CPAS to obtain the Social Integration Income (RIS). At the end of 2025, 20,038 Brussels jobseekers (20.7%) were already registered with the CPAS. Federal compensation is degressive: 100% in the first year, 75% in the fourth. Brussels CPAS describe the situation as "the calm before the storm".

## Why this matters

Employment is the primary determinant of quality of life. With an unemployment rate of 15.4% (Dec. 2025) — the highest of Belgium's three Regions — and a federal reform that excludes 42,000 over 18 months (Actiris estimate), Brussels needs a strong regional political response. In caretaker mode, that response cannot come.
