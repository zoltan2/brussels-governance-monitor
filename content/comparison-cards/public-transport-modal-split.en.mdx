caveat: "Modal split data are published at national level, not regional level. Capital regions generally have a higher public transport modal share than the national average. Comparisons are therefore indicative. Moreover, the definition of collective transport and the methods for measuring passenger-kilometres may vary between countries."

## Context

The public transport modal split measures the proportion of passenger-kilometres travelled by bus, tram, metro and train relative to total inland passenger transport. This indicator, published annually by Eurostat (tran_hv_psmod), enables comparison of collective transport use across European countries. The 2022 data represent the latest complete year available at the time of writing.

## The data compared

Austria stands out clearly with a modal share of 29.8%, the highest among the six selected countries. This result reflects sustained investment in rail infrastructure (OBB) and the excellence of Vienna's public transport network (Wiener Linien), which combines metro, tram and bus into an integrated, affordably priced offering. The introduction of the KlimaTicket at 1,095 euros per year for the entire national network has further boosted the attractiveness of collective transport.

Belgium occupies an intermediate position at 21.7%. In Brussels, the STIB/MIVB operates a dense network that pushes the regional modal share well above the national average. The Brussels network carries more than 400 million passengers annually. However, this national figure masks disparities between the capital and the rural areas of Wallonia and Flanders, where the private car remains largely dominant. France (19.5%) and Germany (18.4%) occupy comparable positions, with developed public transport networks in their respective capitals but national modal shares pulled downward by peri-urban and rural territories.

The Netherlands (11.4%) and Denmark (14.2%) show the lowest modal shares in the panel. This counter-intuitive result for two countries renowned for their sustainable mobility is explained by the dominance of cycling in daily travel. In Copenhagen, nearly 30% of commuting trips are made by bicycle, which mechanically reduces the share of public transport without implying greater car use. The same logic applies to the Netherlands, where cycling accounts for approximately 27% of trips.

## Implications for Brussels

The absence of a fully empowered regional government since June 2024 has direct consequences for public transport investment capacity. The Metro 3 project, intended to connect the north and south of the Region via a new metro line, is frozen due to the lack of political arbitration and budget validation. Investments in tram network extensions and frequency improvements are also on hold.

Without new transport capacity, Brussels risks seeing its modal share stagnate or even decline, while other European capitals continue their investments. Vienna continues to expand its metro network (U5 line under construction), Berlin is investing in extensions of several U-Bahn and S-Bahn lines, and Paris is completing the Grand Paris Express, the largest transport infrastructure project in Europe. Each year of inaction widens the gap with these benchmark cities.
