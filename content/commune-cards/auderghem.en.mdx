## Brussels' only DéFI mayor

Auderghem has 35,000 inhabitants and is led by Sophie de Vos (DéFI), the only DéFI mayor to remain in office in Brussels after the 2024 elections. With 47.1% of votes and an absolute majority (17/31 seats), she opened her majority to MR-Les Engagés.

## Transparency: 5 out of 6 criteria

Auderghem achieves an excellent score. The **budget** and council **minutes** (dedicated archives) are published, the council is broadcast via **livestream**, the **mandate registry** is exemplary (publication of private income of elected officials — a first), and the municipality has the **Auderghem 21: Participate!** platform. No **Open Data** portal.

## Mandate transparency pioneer

Auderghem stands out by publishing the **private income** of the mayor and aldermen, going beyond legal requirements. Councillor attendance tracking is also published online.
