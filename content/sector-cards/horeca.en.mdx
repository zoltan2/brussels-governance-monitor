humanImpact: "The agreement announces a new mobility plan (replacing Good Move), the retention of the LEZ with an annual pass, and the strengthening of Actiris. These measures directly impact the 35,000 jobs and 9,000 establishments in the sector. The federal hotel VAT increase (6% → 12%, 1 March 2026) adds to the sector's burden."

## Hotel VAT reform: federal measure from 1 March 2026

The federal government has decided to raise the **VAT on hotel stays from 6% to 12%** effective 1 March 2026. The Brussels Hotels Association estimates the impact at approximately **+€8.50 on a €150 room night** and denounces a "cocktail of taxes in 2026".

In parallel, the **VAT on soft drinks served in hospitality** drops from 21% to 12%, a partial relief for the restaurant sector. The planned reform of the takeaway food VAT was cancelled by the kern in February 2026.

## Government agreement: announced impacts
According to corroborating press sources, the agreement of 12 February 2026 includes several measures that impact the horeca sector:

- **New mobility plan** replacing Good Move: the revision of traffic arrangements and pedestrian zones will directly affect the accessibility of horeca establishments and operating conditions for terraces
- **LEZ retained with annual pass** (EUR 350, social rate EUR 200): non-compliant delivery vehicles will be able to circulate legally at a predictable annual cost, instead of fines per infringement
- **Stricter activation of jobseekers** and a 70% employment target: in a sector that struggles to recruit, the strengthening of Actiris could improve matching between vacancies and jobseekers
- **Reinforced bilingualism**: the heightened bilingualism ambition benefits a service sector where proficiency in Dutch is an asset for the institutional and European clientele

**Point of attention**: the end of the caretaker period makes it possible to unblock seasonal employment subsidies, terrace permits and regional tourism policy. The revision of Good Move will be closely monitored by horeca operators located in neighbourhoods already redesigned under the plan.

## Inherited situation and contextual data

## An emblematic sector for Brussels

The horeca sector (hotels, restaurants, cafes) is one of the most visible parts of the Brussels economy. With approximately **9,000 establishments** and **35,000 direct jobs**, it constitutes a major economic pillar of the Brussels-Capital Region. The sector is also intimately linked to the city's cultural identity, its tourist appeal and the vitality of its neighbourhoods.

The Brussels horeca sector depends on several regional mechanisms: **seasonal employment subsidies**, **urban planning and terrace permits**, the **tourism policy** led by Visit.brussels, and **sectoral premiums** managed by Actiris and hub.brussels.

Between 9 June 2024 and 14 February 2026, the caretaker regional government could no longer take new decisions in these areas.

## Subsidies for seasonal workers: a critical shortfall

### The mechanism

Brussels horeca is characterised by strong seasonality. The summer months, festive periods and major events (European summits, international conferences) generate peaks in activity that require hiring seasonal workers. The Brussels-Capital Region had developed specific support schemes for these temporary hires.

### What is blocked

Under the caretaker government, no new seasonal employment support scheme could be launched. Existing budgets were frozen at pre-June 2024 levels. In practice:

- **No new subsidies** for hiring seasonal workers in 2025 and 2026
- **No adjustment** of amounts for inflation and rising labour costs
- **No targeted programmes** for hard-to-employ jobseekers in the horeca sector
- **No specific support** for the sector's digital transition

According to Federation Horeca Brussels, this situation forced many establishments to limit their seasonal hiring or offer less favourable contracts to workers.

## Terrace permits: urban policy on hold

### The stakes

Terraces are an essential element of the business model of many Brussels cafes and restaurants. They are also an issue of urban planning, public space sharing and quality of life in neighbourhoods.

The granting of terrace permits and approval of extensions fell under political decisions that could not be taken under the caretaker government, except for matters of day-to-day management.

### The consequences

- **No new terrace permits** for recently opened establishments
- **No extension** of existing terraces into new spaces
- **No regularisation** of provisional arrangements inherited from the COVID period
- **No adaptation** of regulations to new urban realities (pedestrianisation, cycle lanes)

Operators wishing to install or enlarge a terrace had to wait for a fully empowered government to be formed.

## Tourism policy: a strategy on hold

### The context

Brussels welcomed approximately **8.5 million overnight stays** in 2024, up from the post-COVID years. The Region has a dedicated body, **Visit.brussels**, responsible for tourism promotion and sector support.

### What is suspended

The regional strategic tourism plan, which defines priorities and investments for the development of tourism in Brussels, was suspended. Visit.brussels continued its routine promotion activities but could not:

- **Launch major new campaigns** requiring additional budgets
- **Develop new international partnerships** committing the Region
- **Fund new tourist reception infrastructure**
- **Adapt the strategy** to changes in the international tourism market

## Sectoral employment premiums

Regional employment premiums specific to the horeca sector, managed by Actiris, were an important lever for encouraging recruitment in a sector that struggles to attract staff. Under the caretaker government:

- **Premium amounts** could not be increased
- **Eligibility criteria** could not be broadened to new target groups
- **Specific support programmes** could not be strengthened
- **Coordination** between Actiris, Forem and VDAB for commuting workers was frozen

## What continues to function

### Existing support

Employment support programmes committed before June 2024 continue to be implemented. Horeca employers already receiving premiums or subsidies continue to receive them under the agreed terms.

### Basic tourism promotion

Visit.brussels continues its promotion activities within its existing operating budget. Campaigns planned before June 2024 are being carried out normally.

### Support services

Actiris and hub.brussels continue to support jobseekers and entrepreneurs in the horeca sector with existing resources.

## Impact on the ground

The freeze on regional mechanisms had direct consequences for the sector's daily life:

- **Reduced seasonal employment**: fewer seasonal positions opened during peak periods
- **Postponed investments**: renovation and expansion projects were on hold
- **Weakened competitiveness**: Brussels establishments were disadvantaged compared to neighbouring regions that adapted their policies
- **Stagnating tourist appeal**: without new initiatives, Brussels lost ground to other European capitals

## Outlook

The Brussels horeca sector demonstrated its resilience during the health crisis. But the combination of persistent inflation, structural recruitment difficulties and the absence of an active regional policy weakened a sector already under pressure.

Each tourist season without adapted support represented lost revenue for establishments, a missed employment opportunity for workers and a weakening of Brussels' economic attractiveness.
