## What happened

On 20 December 2024, the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region voted a provisional twelfths ordinance for the first quarter of 2025. This vote allowed the regional administration to continue operating in the absence of a new budget adopted by a new government.

## What are provisional twelfths

The provisional twelfths mechanism allows the Region to spend a maximum of one twelfth of the last approved budget (that of 2024) each month. This regime does not authorise any new expenditure or any new programmes. It is a budgetary survival mechanism, not an instrument of governance.

## The consequences

This vote marked the official entry of the Region into a degraded budgetary regime:

- **No new investments**: projects that were not budgeted in 2024 remain frozen
- **Erosion through inflation**: nominal amounts remain identical to 2024 while prices rise
- **Blocked subsidies**: expired agreements cannot be renewed

The Court of Audit accompanied this vote with a report highlighting the risks of a prolonged provisional twelfths regime for regional finances.
