## RPD commitments

The Regional Policy Declaration of 13 February 2026 devotes a chapter to the economy and international attractiveness of Brussels.

### Urban Free Zone

The government plans the creation of an **Urban Free Zone** at two sites:

- **Port of Brussels** — logistics and industrial vocation
- **Audi Forest site** — industrial reconversion after the factory closure

Three levers are planned:
- **Tax lever** — reduction of property tax and registration rights within the zone
- **Administrative lever** — single Fast-Track window for businesses
- **Human lever** — dedicated Actiris cell for jobs in the zone

### Attractiveness and innovation

- Positioning Brussels as the **capital of artificial intelligence**
- Hub.Brussels: continued international economic missions
- Innoviris: integrated process with Finance.Brussels
- GovTech hub (Schuman, Mediapark, Kanal)

### Culture and major projects

- **Kanal** — museum opening with new governance and management contract
- **Brussels Expo CONFEX** (CONference + EXhibition) at the Heysel, funded via NEO
- Support for the nightlife sector and events
- Zinneke Parade and BXL 2030: support confirmed

### Social economy and entrepreneurship

- Strong commitment to social economy
- Support for female entrepreneurship and diversity

### Sport

- **RUSG** — stadium at Bempt (Forest)

## Federal impact: hotel VAT increase (1 March 2026)

The federal government has decided to raise the **VAT on hotel stays from 6% to 12%** effective 1 March 2026. This measure, part of the federal budget agreement, directly affects the Brussels hotel sector — Brussels accounts for the majority of the country's tourist and business overnight stays.

The Brussels Hotels Association estimates the impact at approximately **+€8.50 on a €150 room night**. The federation denounces a "cocktail of taxes in 2026" combining this increase with other levies.

In parallel, the VAT on soft drinks served in hospitality establishments drops from 21% to 12%, a partial relief for the restaurant sector.

The regional RPD provides for **free zones** and attractiveness measures to partly offset these increased federal charges.

## Sources and methodology

The commitments documented above come from the official text of the RPD (chapter 8) and from concordant press sources covering the government agreement of 12 February 2026.
