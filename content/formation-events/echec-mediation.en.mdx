## What happened

On 30 October 2025, the facilitator submitted a final report to the President of the Brussels Parliament. The report concluded that a framework agreement on linguistic balances could not be reached within the allotted timeframe.

## The report's conclusions

The facilitator set out three principal findings:

1. **The deadlock is structural, not programmatic**: the parties are relatively close on the substance of a government programme, but fundamentally diverge on the architecture of decision-making
2. **Positions have moved closer without converging**: the facilitation clarified positions and narrowed the gap, but a divide remains on veto mechanisms and special majorities
3. **A solution will require strong political will**: the facilitator considered that an agreement is technically possible, but requires top-level political commitment from the parties

## The impact

The failure of the facilitation reinforced the sense of deadlock. If even an actor outside the political arena was unable to unblock the situation, what options remained? The Brussels Parliament found itself in an unprecedented situation: more than 16 months without a government, and no clear path towards a solution.

Nevertheless, the facilitator's work was not lost. The framework proposal and the analysis of positions would serve as a basis for subsequent attempts.
