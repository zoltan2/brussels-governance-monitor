## What happened

Overnight from Wednesday 11 to Thursday 12 February, the negotiators from the 7 parties continued discussions without interruption at the University Foundation. Talks focused on bilateral meetings between the formateur and each party, ahead of a plenary session convened at 11:30 AM on Thursday morning.

## State of negotiations

The three remaining sticking points identified the previous day have largely advanced:

- **Good Move**: the issue is described as "broadly settled" — the mobility plan would be fundamentally reworked, remaining work concerns the wording
- **Regional brownfields**: agreement in principle on vacant land management for housing
- **Budget**: the bulk of remaining work — the 2029 equilibrium trajectory commands consensus, detailed arbitrations are ongoing

## Strong signal

MR and Les Engagés have called participation congresses for Thursday evening — a clear signal that the agreement is imminent. Parties do not convene their members without a text to present.

## Context

613 days after the regional elections of 9 June 2024, Brussels is closer than ever to a fully empowered government.
