## General situation

PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), often called "forever chemicals", are virtually indestructible chemical compounds used in numerous industrial and consumer products. Unlike Flanders (3M factory in Zwijndrecht), no PFAS production facility is present in the Brussels Region. Contamination comes from the widespread use of PFAS-containing products and specific industrial sites.

Since 2021, Brussels Environment has conducted systematic analysis campaigns. To date, **82 parcels** show confirmed contamination: 47 in soil and 55 in groundwater.

## The Sicli case in Uccle

The most serious case involves the former Sicli company site (fire extinguisher manufacturer), Chaussée de Neerstalle 430 in Uccle. The firefighting foams produced on site contained large quantities of PFOS and PFOA.

- **April–May 2023**: analyses commissioned by Sicli reveal extreme concentrations
- **December 2023**: Brussels Environment is informed of the results
- **June 2025**: joint public announcement with the municipality of Uccle, after Sicli's bankruptcy and the trustees' refusal to continue analyses
- **September 2025**: detailed results published — **31 PFAS compounds** in soil (standard exceeded up to **708 times**) and **20 compounds** in groundwater (standard exceeded up to **1,058 times**) on the industrial site; off-site levels 1.4 to 530 times the standard

A 100-metre safety perimeter has been established: consumption of fruits, vegetables, eggs or small livestock from gardens in the zone is prohibited. Drinking water distributed by Vivaqua is not affected.

## Drinking water: the TFA problem

Vivaqua states that the European standard of 100 ng/L for the sum of 20 PFAS is not exceeded anywhere in the Region. However, analyses reveal a specific problem with **TFA (trifluoroacetic acid)**:

- TFA is detected in all **6 reservoirs** supplying Brussels residents
- **97% of 287 analyses** exceed the future standard of 500 ng/L for total PFAS
- Concentrations range from 500 to 1,900 ng/L (maximum at the Daussoulx-Boitsfort reservoir)
- Standard activated carbon filters cannot capture TFA — only reverse osmosis works, at a high cost

TFA toxicity remains debated: an independent scientific council considers the human risk as "unlikely", but Dutch health authorities point to potential effects on the liver and immune system.

## Regulatory framework

- **March 2024**: EU standard of 100 ng/L (sum of 20 PFAS) in force in Brussels
- **May 2024**: decree integrating PFAS standards for soil and groundwater (published in the Belgian Official Journal on 9 July 2024)
- **April 2025**: the government approves in first reading a draft defining "total PFAS" at 500 ng/L and adding TFA to the watchlist (guidance value: 2,200 ng/L)
- **February 2026**: the Environment Council calls for an **integrated framework** — management of existing contamination, sustainable protection of drinking water, polluter-pays principle, equitable cost distribution

At European level, a general PFAS ban is not expected before late 2026. A regulation banning PFAS in firefighting foams (≥1 mg/L) was voted in April 2025.

## Issues to monitor

- **Sicli remediation**: who pays after bankruptcy? Brussels Environment is negotiating with owner Afitec
- **Water treatment costs**: reverse osmosis to remove TFA could be reflected in consumer bills
- **Integrated framework**: will the Brussels government respond to the Environment Council's recommendations?
- **Mapping**: analysis campaigns continue — the number of contaminated parcels may increase
- **TFA standard**: the guidance value of 2,200 ng/L proposed by the Region is considered insufficient by some experts
