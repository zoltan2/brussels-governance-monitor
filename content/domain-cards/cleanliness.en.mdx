## RPD commitments

The Regional Policy Declaration of 13 February 2026 devotes a chapter to public cleanliness, identified as a major citizen concern.

### Agency reform

- Reform of the Brussels Cleanliness Agency (ABP) — reorganisation of collection and improved working conditions

### Collection infrastructure

- **Underground containers** and **compactors** — deployment in high-density neighbourhoods
- Special rapid intervention unit for "Cleanliness"

### Cleanliness brigades

- Creation of **regional cleanliness brigades** — coordinated regional and municipal agents
- Deployment of **smart cameras** in areas at risk of illegal dumping

### Sanctions

- **Immediate fine collection** for observed offences
- Combating illegal waste importation from other regions

## Nitrous oxide: 2025 operational data

Bruxelles-Propreté collected **75 tonnes** of nitrous oxide cylinders in 2025, of which over 50 tonnes came from clandestine dumps. The total cost of safety and treatment measures amounts to **€12 million**, of which €9 million is a direct charge on the agency's budget.

A shredder installed since June 2025 enables cylinders to be neutralised before incineration. Incinerator explosions decreased by 37% (from 797 to approximately 500) and operational shutdowns by 29% (from 35 to 25 per year).

Since March 2024, a royal decree prohibits the sale and possession of nitrous oxide for recreational purposes. However, Bruxelles-Propreté considers the legislation insufficient, as it relies on buyers' oral declarations.

## Sources and methodology

The commitments documented above come from the official text of the RPD (chapter 10) and from concordant press sources covering the government agreement of 12 February 2026. Nitrous oxide operational data comes from the official Bruxelles-Propreté communiqué of 10 February 2026 and the BX1 report of 17 February 2026.
