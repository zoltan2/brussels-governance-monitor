## What happened

On 1 February 2026, the citizen collective **respect.brussels** organised an unprecedented meeting: representatives of all 11 parties present in the Brussels Parliament agreed to sit around the same table, in a non-partisan framework organised by citizens.

## The respect.brussels collective

Born from citizen exasperation at the length of the crisis, respect.brussels brings together Brussels residents from all backgrounds. The collective does not advocate a political programme and does not support any party. Its sole objective: to secure the formation of a functioning regional government as soon as possible.

## The meeting

The meeting of 1 February 2026 stood apart from classical political negotiations in several respects:

- **Citizen framework**: it was civil society that convened, not Parliament
- **Total inclusivity**: all 11 parties were present, including those in the opposition -- parties that had stopped communicating were brought back to the same table
- **Transparency**: the collective made public the commitments given by the parties
- **Concrete agenda**: focus on a formation timetable and minimum principles

## Concrete results

The meeting produced tangible advances:

- **"Demineurs" principle**: a duo of political figures was tasked with clearing the obstacles to formation, ahead of a possible new formateur
- **Lifting of vetoes**: personal vetoes that had been blocking the formation for months were lifted
- **Transversal contacts**: French-speaking and Dutch-speaking parties that had stopped communicating resumed dialogue

## The significance

This initiative marked a turning point in the Brussels crisis. For the first time, it was the citizens -- not the institutions -- who created a space for political dialogue that produced concrete results. The demineurs principle represents a new approach to government formation, unprecedented in Belgium.
