## Coalition Agreement: Announced Commitments
According to concordant press sources, the agreement of 12 February 2026 announces measures for the cultural sector:

- **Kanal saved**: **EUR 60 million** for the opening of the contemporary art museum (former Citroen garage). The annual operating budget will be degressive, with a requirement to seek own revenue
- **Review of discretionary subsidies**: all regional subsidy envelopes will be re-examined as part of the EUR 1.2 billion fiscal consolidation effort

**Point of attention**: the rescue of Kanal (EUR 60M) is a major investment, but the systematic review of discretionary subsidies could affect other regional cultural institutions. The details of the overall cultural arbitration are not yet known.

## Converging budgetary pressures (February 2026)

The Brussels cultural sector faces simultaneous cuts at **three levels of government**:

### Federation Wallonia-Brussels

The FWB 2026 budget, adopted in late February, provides for **EUR 255 million in total savings**, including **EUR 12.9 million** in cuts to the cultural sector (approximately 4% of a cultural budget of EUR 320M+). Concrete measures:

- **Non-indexation** of cultural subsidies in 2026
- **Moratorium on new recognitions** and accreditations until 2028 (cultural centres, public libraries, arts, continuing education)
- Cumulative FWB savings reach **EUR 500 million over 4 years** (2026-2029)

### City of Brussels

The City of Brussels reduced its cultural budget by **15 to 20%** between 2024 and 2026. Concrete consequences:

- **La Centrale** (contemporary art centre): **closed** in February 2026
- **FAME Festival**: funding cancelled
- Reduction in subsidies to the Theatre Royal du Parc and the KVS

### Alarm from the sector

**RAB/BKO** (Brussels Arts Network, 168 cultural actors) launched a public appeal for **financial guarantees** for 2026, denouncing an "unbearable uncertainty". Organisations have laid off staff, imposed part-time work or ceased their activities.

The **Zinneke Parade 2026**, an emblematic Brussels event, has no confirmed regional structural funding.

## Inherited situation and contextual data

## Brussels, a cultural capital under pressure

Brussels occupies a unique place in the European cultural landscape. As a bilingual city at the heart of Europe, it is home to approximately **300 subsidised cultural institutions** and generates some **15,000 jobs** in the cultural sector. Theatres, museums, art centres, concert halls, galleries, dance companies and artistic collectives make the capital an internationally recognised creative hub.

The funding of this cultural vitality relies on a system involving **several levels of government** that must be clearly distinguished:

- **Community (FWB, Flemish Community)**: the majority of cultural subsidies in Brussels. Multi-year programme contracts, accreditations and structural funding for major institutions fall under Community competence. This level **continues to operate**, but without indexation of funding envelopes.
- **Regional (Brussels-Capital Region)**: co-funding of cultural projects, one-off subsidies, regional accreditations, inter-level coordination. This level has been **frozen** since 9 June 2024.
- **Municipal**: municipal subsidies for local initiatives, provision of venues and infrastructure. This level continues but some communes have made budget cuts.

Between 9 June 2024 and 14 February 2026, the **specifically regional** mechanisms were frozen. Community competences continued but were progressively eroding due to non-indexation.

## Cultural subsidies: the heart of the problem

### The mechanism

The Brussels-Capital Region devotes an annual budget of approximately **EUR 120 million** to cultural policies, directly or through the community commissions. These funds finance the operations of cultural institutions, artistic programming, artist residencies, cultural mediation projects and support for emerging creators.

### What is blocked

Under the caretaker government, the entire system of regional cultural funding was frozen:

- **No new subsidies** for emerging cultural projects
- **No revaluation** of existing allocations to account for inflation
- **No additional support** for structures in financial difficulty
- **No regional calls for proposals** for artistic creation

Institutions receiving structural subsidies committed before June 2024 continue to receive them. But every new application goes unanswered.

## Festivals: a nuanced situation

### The Kunstenfestivaldesarts

The **Kunstenfestivaldesarts**, an internationally renowned performing arts festival, is primarily funded by the **Federation Wallonia-Brussels** and the **Flemish Community** (community competence). These multi-year subsidies **continue to be disbursed**, even without a regional government. The festival is therefore **not directly threatened** by the regional crisis.

However, the regional co-funding share could not be renewed or increased under the caretaker government, which limited room for development.

### Events more directly affected

Festivals and events that rely more heavily on **specifically regional** funding are more exposed:

- Events linked to Brussels heritage (regional competence)
- Intercultural and bilingual events characteristic of Brussels
- The Zinneke Parade and Image de Bruxelles festivals, whose regional funding is significant

### The concrete consequences

- **Postponed ambitious projects**: productions requiring regional co-production are suspended
- **Loss of international partnerships**: foreign institutions hesitate to commit without regional co-funding guarantees
- **Increased precarity for artists**: fewer commissions and residencies funded at the regional level

## Community centres: the local cultural fabric

### The role of the centres

Cultural and community centres form the local cultural network across the 19 Brussels municipalities. They offer spaces for creation, dissemination and artistic practice accessible to all audiences, and play an essential role in neighbourhood social cohesion.

### The impact of the freeze

Allocations to regional community centres could not be increased or redirected. In practice:

- **No refinancing** to offset inflation of operating costs (energy, rent, equipment)
- **No new missions** entrusted to the centres (digital mediation, reaching new audiences)
- **No investment** in the renovation of local cultural infrastructure
- **No adaptation** of programming to the changing needs of neighbourhoods

Centres that had been operating on tight budgets for years saw their room for manoeuvre shrink further.

## Cultural accreditations: the door closed to new initiatives

Under the caretaker government, no new accreditation could be issued to cultural structures. This blocked:

- The **official recognition** of new companies or artistic collectives
- **Access to public funding** for young structures
- **Changes to accreditation** for institutions wishing to expand their activities
- The **creation of new cultural venues** requiring regional accreditation

Source: French Community Commission, report on cultural accreditations, 2025.

## What continues to function

### Community funding (the majority)

The **majority of cultural subsidies** in Brussels come from the community level: the Federation Wallonia-Brussels and the Flemish Community fully exercise their cultural competences, independently of the regional crisis. Multi-year programme contracts are maintained. However, the absence of indexation is causing a **progressive erosion** of real funding, estimated at several percentage points per year.

### Ongoing regional structural funding

Regional structural subsidies committed before June 2024 continue to be disbursed. Beneficiary institutions receive their allocations under existing agreements.

### Artistic autonomy

Cultural institutions with their own reserves, box office revenues, community funding or private funding continued to programme their seasons. Artistic creation did not stop, but complementary regional resources were frozen.

## The populations most affected

The freeze on regional cultural mechanisms affected people unevenly:

- **Young creators** who could not access their first public funding
- **Emerging companies** whose projects remain shelved
- **Audiences in working-class neighbourhoods** who depend on community centres for access to culture
- **Intermittent cultural workers** whose work opportunities are shrinking
- **Artists not affiliated with major institutions**, who are more dependent on one-off subsidies

## What BGM does not say

This card **does not say** that all cultural funding in Brussels was blocked. The majority of cultural subsidies come from the community level (Federation Wallonia-Brussels, Flemish Community), where multi-year commitments continue. The regional crisis affects the **specifically regional** levers -- co-funding, regional accreditations, inter-level coordination -- and not the entire system.

Furthermore, the cultural sector faces pressures from **other levels of government** that are not linked to the regional crisis: non-indexation of community programme contracts, federal budget cuts to national institutions, VAT increases on leisure, reductions to Creative Europe at the European level. These factors accumulate alongside the regional freeze but do not stem from it.

## Bookstores and the book trade in Brussels

### An economically fragile sector

The **Press & Books** sub-sector is the only segment of the cultural and creative industries (CCI) in decline in Brussels: **-3%** of enterprises over ten years, while the overall CCI sector is growing (+21% in jobs since 2013). It nevertheless accounts for **4,200 enterprises** and **EUR 1.7 billion** in turnover (source: hub.brussels, CCI study 2023).

Brussels has approximately **30 independent bookstores** of small to medium size. Their average profit margin is approximately **1%** of turnover — an extremely precarious balance. French-language bookstores additionally lose 0.5% margin on books imported from France (VAT 5.5% in France vs 6% in Belgium).

### Filigranes: near-bankruptcy and revival

**Filigranes**, Belgium's largest bookstore (accounting for roughly one-tenth of all physical book purchases in the country), narrowly avoided bankruptcy in 2024 after two restructurings in 18 months. Acquired in December 2024 by businessman Mehmet Sandurac (EUR 305,000 + EUR 1.5 million investment), it reopened on 23 April 2025 at Boulevard de Waterloo (Mayfair) with 30 employees and ~150,000 titles.

### Chain reorganisations

**Club** (Standaard Boekhandel subsidiary) underwent a reorganisation in 2024. The **Club Flagey** and **Club Dockx** stores in Brussels were transferred to Press Shop & More. The brand was renamed "Librairie Club" in 2025. **Furet du Nord** went bankrupt in Belgium (Louvain-la-Neuve, Namur).

### The Brussels Book Fair

The **54th Brussels Book Fair** (Tour & Taxis, March 2025) attracted a record **85,000 visitors** (+13% vs 2024), with 1,200 authors, 300 exhibitors and 500 publishing houses represented. The 55th edition is planned for 26-29 March 2026.

### Federal threat: VAT at 9%

The proposed Arizona federal coalition plans a VAT increase on books from **6% to 9%**. The French-language booksellers' union calls the measure "catastrophic" for a network operating on 1% margins. Such an increase would encourage cross-border online purchasing at the expense of physical bookstores.

## Outlook

The Brussels cultural sector survived the health crisis thanks to emergency mechanisms. But the institutional crisis was different: it did not trigger exceptional support measures. The freeze was silent, gradual and cumulative.

Each season without an active cultural policy represented an impoverishment of the offering, a loss of talent and a weakening of Brussels' international reputation as a cultural capital.
