The French Community of Belgium, which has presented itself under the name Federation Wallonia-Brussels since 2011, is one of the three Communities in the Belgian federal system. It exercises its competences for French-speakers in Wallonia and Brussels. Its areas of activity cover education (from nursery to university), culture, audiovisual media, scientific research, youth welfare, sport and justice centres.

In Brussels, French-speaking community competences are exercised either directly by the Federation Wallonia-Brussels or by the COCOF in matters that have been transferred to it. This division creates a complex architecture where French-speaking schools in Brussels fall under the Federation, while vocational training is a COCOF responsibility. The Federation's Parliament is composed of the 75 members of the Walloon Parliament and 19 French-speaking members of the Brussels Parliament.

The Federation Wallonia-Brussels has its own government and is not directly affected by the Brussels regional formation crisis. However, interactions between levels of government are numerous, and the absence of a full regional government complicates policy coordination, particularly in education, early childhood and cultural policies in Brussels.
