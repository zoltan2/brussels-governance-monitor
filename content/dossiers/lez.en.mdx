## Background

Brussels' LEZ (Low Emission Zone) was established in 2018 to improve air quality by progressively banning the most polluting vehicles from the regional territory. The schedule provides for a gradual tightening of access standards, with the goal of banning diesel vehicles by 2030 and petrol vehicles by 2035.

## Impact of the Crisis

The LEZ continues to operate under the rules already adopted. However, the next tightening phases require political decisions:

- Confirmation or adjustment of the 2025-2030 schedule
- Adoption of social support measures (replacement grants, alternative mobility options)
- Review of exemptions

The caretaker government can maintain the existing framework but cannot adopt new regulatory phases.

## Key Issues

- **Public health**: air quality in Brussels remains below WHO recommendations in several areas
- **Social justice**: low-income households often own the oldest vehicles and are the first affected by restrictions
- **Climate coherence**: delays in tightening the rules compromise the Region's climate objectives
