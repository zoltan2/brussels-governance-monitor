Iriscare is the executive arm of the Joint Community Commission (COCOM/GGC) for health and social welfare matters. Created in 2019 following the 6th reform of the Belgian State, it manages accreditations for care facilities, funds nursing homes and outpatient mental health services, and coordinates Brussels family allowances through Famiris.

During the caretaker period (June 2024 — February 2026), Iriscare continued its core missions but was unable to issue new accreditations or renew expired agreements.
