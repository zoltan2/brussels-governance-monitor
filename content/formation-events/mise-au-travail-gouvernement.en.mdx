## Immediate start of work

From the day after the swearing-in on 14 February, the government launched a tight schedule:

- **Saturday 14 and Sunday 15 February** — informal electronic meetings between government members
- **Thursday 19 February** — first formal council of ministers
- **Monday 23 February** — presentation of the Regional Policy Declaration (RPD) to the Brussels Parliament
- **Wednesday 25 February** — confidence vote in Parliament

The Budget Minister is preparing the 2026 budgetary framework this week. The target is to finalise the budget within three weeks.

## First budget measures

The government announced several immediate austerity measures as part of the trajectory towards balanced budgets by 2029:

- **Hiring freeze** in the regional civil service (no layoffs)
- **Reduction of external consultant use**
- **Cuts to discretionary subsidies** — systematic review of all funding envelopes
- **Target**: bring the deficit below EUR 1 billion in 2026, balanced budget by 2029

## Language controversy

The Minister-President publicly acknowledged his insufficient command of Dutch. The RPD lists bilingualism as a priority for the government. The Dutch-language press covered this issue extensively, highlighting its significance in an officially bilingual region.

## Political reactions

The PTB, the main opposition group in the Brussels Parliament, denounced what it called an "austerity government". The party argues that EUR 1 billion in cuts could affect affordable housing, STIB public transport operations, public services and the Brussels associative sector. Economic stakeholders, for their part, welcomed the swift start and called for an acceleration of reforms.
