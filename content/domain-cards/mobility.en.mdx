## What is blocked

### Metro 3 — North-South Line

The Metro 3 project aims to create a new metro line connecting the north of Brussels (Bordet) to the south (Albert) via Gare du Nord and Gare du Midi stations. The first construction phases (converting existing pre-metro to full metro between Albert and Gare du Nord) are underway as they were already approved and funded. However, **the extension to Bordet** (the most ambitious and costly part) requires new political decisions:

- Approval of the definitive route north of Schaerbeek
- Multi-year budget commitment
- Coordination with Master Development Plans (PAD)

Without a full government, these decisions cannot be taken.

### Road tunnels

Brussels has more than 30 road tunnels, several of which require major renovation. The Stephanie, Loi and Bailli tunnels are among the priorities identified by Brussels Mobility. Routine maintenance continues (carried out by the administration), but major structural renovation projects require:

- A budget arbitration (envelopes of several tens of millions of euros per tunnel)
- A political choice on priorities (which tunnel to renovate first)
- Often, coordination with other projects (Good Move, cycling infrastructure)

### Good Move — Regional Mobility Plan

Good Move is the regional mobility plan adopted in 2020. The neighbourhood zones already implemented continue to function. However, **the rollout of new neighbourhood zones and adjustments based on citizen feedback** require government decisions. In caretaker mode, only minor adjustments are possible.

## What continues to function

- **STIB**: daily operations (bus, tram, metro) continue normally under the existing management contract
- **Villo** and **Jump/Lime**: shared mobility services under existing concessions
- **Routine road maintenance**: potholes, signage, traffic lights
- **Already approved works**: construction sites launched before June 2024 continue

## Why this matters

Mobility is the most visible domain for Brussels residents in their daily lives. Each day of delay in infrastructure projects has a cost:

- Economic cost (congestion, time lost)
- Environmental cost (delay in the transition to public transport)
- Social cost (accessibility of underserved neighbourhoods)

Precise data on these costs is difficult to estimate as it depends on complex modelling. BGM does not publish a quantified estimate of the economic cost of these delays to avoid unsourced speculation.
