## How it works

At the Brussels regional level, the formation of a government follows a different process from the federal level. **There is no royal intervention**: the Brussels Parliament manages the formation itself. A party leader or political figure typically takes the initiative to explore coalition possibilities.

The typical process:

1. **Exploratory phase** — informal contacts between party leaders to identify possible configurations
2. **Appointment of a formateur** — Parliament tasks a person with negotiating an agreement
3. **Policy negotiation** — the parties negotiate the content of the government programme
4. **Portfolio allocation** — who gets which ministry
5. **Vote of confidence** — Parliament votes its confidence in the new government

## Why this is the most likely scenario

Historically, Belgium always ends up forming a classical government, even if it takes time. At the federal level:

- **2010-2011**: 541 days -> Di Rupo government (compromise on the splitting of BHV)
- **2019-2020**: 494 days -> De Croo government (triggered by the COVID crisis)

At the Brussels regional level, formations have always been faster than at the federal level, because the number of parties is more limited and the institutional (community-related) stakes are less weighty.

## The current state (February 2026)

The Region has now been without a government for over **610 days** (February 2026), surpassing the federal record of 541 days (2010-2011). Seven political figures have successively failed in informateur or formateur roles.

On **20 January 2026**, the latest formateur submitted a resignation to the President of the Brussels Parliament, closing the 5th formation round. A key Dutch-speaking partner refused at the last moment to commit.

On **1 February 2026**, the citizen collective respect.brussels brought representatives of all 11 Brussels parties around the same table -- a first in the crisis. From this meeting emerged the principle of "demineurs": a duo of political figures tasked with clearing the obstacles to formation. Vetoes that had been blocking the formation were lifted, and parties that had stopped communicating were brought back to the same table.

## Structural obstacles

Without going into the details of party positions (that is not BGM's role), the structural obstacles identified in the press and academic analyses are:

- Political fragmentation following the 2024 elections
- Disagreements over budgetary priorities (debt of 15.65 billion EUR)
- Institutional questions related to Brussels governance
- The requirement for a double linguistic majority (FR + NL) to pass a vote of confidence

## Legal basis

The Special Act on Institutional Reforms of 12 January 1989, which governs Brussels institutions, **sets no deadline** for government formation. There is no automatic mechanism that would force a formation (unlike some countries where new elections are triggered automatically after a certain period).

The outgoing government remains in office in a "caretaker" capacity for as long as necessary — that is, until a new government is sworn in.
