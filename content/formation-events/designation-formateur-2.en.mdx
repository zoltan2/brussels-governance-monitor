## What happened

On 1 June 2025, the Brussels Parliament designated a second formateur, from the PS. This choice was consistent with the informateurs' recommendation: the PS holds the largest number of seats among the six parties of the expanded progressive coalition.

## The mandate

Unlike the first formateur, who had an open mandate, the second formateur received a targeted mandate: to negotiate a government agreement between the PS, Ecolo, Groen, Les Engages, Vooruit and one.brussels. The coalition was identified; what remained was to negotiate the programme and the allocation of portfolios.

## The context

The designation came as the Region had been in caretaker mode for nearly a year. The pressure to succeed was considerable:
- The regional budget was running on provisional twelfths
- Several urgent dossiers (housing, mobility, climate) were on hold
- Public opinion was showing signs of impatience

The formateur announced an intention to work to a tight timetable, with the ambition of presenting an agreement before the September session.
