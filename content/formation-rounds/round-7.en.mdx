## Context

After the failure of the third formateur (Round 5) and the unprecedented citizen pressure of Round 6, the MR president takes the initiative on 8 February 2026 to bring together 7 parties for a "finish conclave". The decisive turning point comes on 9 February when the Flemish liberal party agrees to negotiate **without the N-VA**, removing the lock that had blocked the formation for over 600 days.

## The configuration

For the first time in this crisis, a coalition commands a **double linguistic majority**:

- **French-speaking side**: MR, PS, Les Engagés
- **Dutch-speaking side**: Groen, Vooruit, Anders, CD&V

### The Flemish liberal pivot

The decisive moment is the reversal by Anders (ex-Open VLD), who had refused three times to negotiate without the N-VA. Preliminary budget work between Anders and the PS created common ground. The Anders delegation leader stated: "There is a difference between being right and getting what you want."

### The conclave format

The chosen format — continuous negotiation at the University Foundation, Rue d'Egmont, without leaving the premises — aims to force an agreement before the carnival break. Negotiators were instructed to book hotel rooms. The agenda: budgetary framework targeting balance by 2029 + general policy statement.

## The stakes

- **Budget**: approximately EUR 1 billion deficit, balance required by 2029
- **Security**: 101 shootings in one year, 8 deaths — drug-related crime on the rise
- **Dutch-speaking arithmetic**: 4 Flemish parties for 3 ministerial posts — an additional secretary of state position may be created
- **Pressure factor**: Standard & Poor's visit imminent, Vivaqua and SLRB in financial asphyxiation

## Day 1 — Tensions with Groen (10 February)

From the very first day, tensions erupt around Groen. The party rejects the budgetary trajectory aiming for balance by 2029 and contests the abandonment of the Good Move plan in the draft regional policy declaration. Groen finds itself isolated against the 6 other parties. Without Groen, the double linguistic majority is compromised.

## Day 2 — Progress but sticking points (11 February)

After over 24 hours of continuous negotiations, most chapters of the regional policy declaration have been addressed. Partial agreements are emerging on the LEZ and brownfields. The required savings figure is refined: **EUR 1.3 billion** by 2029. Groen remains under maximum pressure. The formateur is aiming for an agreement by Thursday 12 February.

RTBF summarised: "We have never been closer to an agreement forming a Brussels government. And at the same time, we are still very far from it."

## Day 3 — Agreement (12 February)

After an uninterrupted night of negotiations, the final points (budget, Good Move, brownfields) are settled. MR and Les Engagés call participation congresses for Thursday evening — a clear signal that a text is ready. In the late afternoon, the white smoke is announced: the 7 parties have concluded a government agreement.

## Outcome

**Agreement reached on 12 February 2026**, after 613 days of caretaker government. Key measures: return to budget balance by 2029, new mobility plan replacing Good Move, Metro 3 halted in favour of a tram, consolidation of Vivaqua and SLRB, Renolution subsidies scrapped in their current form, LEZ fines reduced, creation of a regional drug commissioner.

Party congresses must validate the agreement, followed by allocation of ministerial portfolios and designation by the Brussels Parliament. The oath-taking before the King (constitutional formality) is planned for Friday or Saturday 14-15 February.
