## Government agreement: announced impacts
According to concordant press sources, the agreement of 12 February 2026 includes several measures that affect the bi-communal health and social sector:

- **Administrative reform (merger of pillars)**: the merger of 25 regional bodies into 3 to 4 entities could affect the governance of COCOM and Iriscare. The precise terms are not yet known
- **Regional drugs commissioner**: this new role, announced under the security chapter, intersects with COCOM's competences in harm reduction and addiction care
- **Budgetary effort**: the trajectory to return to balance by 2029 implies an expenditure review that also concerns COCOM's budgets, which are already operating on provisional twelfths

**Key consideration**: the end of the caretaker period makes it possible to unblock accreditations, Iriscare agreements and the structural plan to combat homelessness. The scale of this relaunch will depend on upcoming budgetary arbitrations.

The following sections document the inherited situation and contextual data.

## COCOM: a key institution for social affairs in Brussels

The Joint Community Commission (COCOM), known in Dutch as the Gemeenschappelijke Gemeenschapscommissie (GGC), is the bi-communal institution responsible for personal assistance and health matters in Brussels. It covers so-called "bi-personal" matters: those that fall under neither the French Community nor the Flemish Community exclusively, but address all Brussels residents regardless of their linguistic affiliation.

Its scope of action is broad:

- **Nursing homes and care homes** (MRS)
- **Home care** for the elderly and dependent persons
- **Outpatient mental health services**
- **Homelessness policy** and emergency shelter
- **Early childhood care** (bi-communal component)
- **Services for people with disabilities**
- **Bi-communal hospitals**

Between June 2024 and February 2026, COCOM operated under a caretaker government and its budget was managed through provisional twelfths. Its executive arm, **Iriscare**, continued its core missions but could not commit any significant new expenditure.

## The freeze on accreditations: the door is closed

### The accreditation mechanism

Accreditation is the act by which COCOM recognises that a care facility or service meets the required quality and safety standards. It determines access to public funding and, in most cases, is a legal requirement to operate.

### Since June 2024: zero new accreditations

Under the caretaker government, COCOM could not issue **any new accreditation**. The consequences were direct:

- **No new nursing homes** despite the ageing of the Brussels population. The number of people over 80 in Brussels increased each year, but the supply of residential care was frozen.
- **No new day centres** for elderly or disabled persons
- **No new accredited home care services**
- **No capacity extensions** for existing facilities that are saturated

Facilities that submitted accreditation applications before June 2024 see their files on indefinite hold. Some have invested in premises, recruited staff and find themselves without official recognition.

## Iriscare agreements: funding under pressure

### The role of agreements

Iriscare, the public interest body that implements COCOM policy, funds care providers and facilities through multi-year agreements. These agreements define the missions, resources and quality objectives for each accredited service.

### The refinancing blockage

Several multi-year agreements expired since June 2024. Under the caretaker government, Iriscare could not:

- **Renew** expired agreements under updated conditions
- **Revalue** rates to account for inflation and rising costs
- **Adapt** agreements to evolving needs (ageing, mental health, precariousness)
- **Fund** new pilot projects or experiments

Care providers continued to operate on the basis of tacit renewals under previous conditions. The gap between actual costs and funding widened each month.

### Provisional twelfths

COCOM's budget was managed through provisional twelfths: each month, one twelfth of the previous year's budget was released. This mechanism guaranteed continuity of operations but prohibited:

- Any **budget increase**, even to cover indexation
- Any **new investment** in infrastructure or equipment
- Any **new policy**, even if it responds to a documented urgent need

## Homelessness policy: the permanent emergency

### The figures

The count carried out by Bruss'Help in November 2024 recorded **7,134 homeless or without-a-home people** in Brussels. This figure has been rising steadily:

- 2018: 4,187 people
- 2020: 5,313 people
- 2022: 6,496 people
- 2024: 7,134 people

The increase is **70% in six years**. It affects all profiles: single people, families with children, young adults, elderly people, migrants in transit.

### What works

- The **winter emergency scheme**: each year, additional emergency shelter places are opened during the winter period (November to March). This scheme is recurrent and funded from existing budgets.
- **Bruss'Help**: the coordinating organisation for the homelessness sector continues its missions of counting, referral and coordination between stakeholders.
- **Existing reception centres**: facilities accredited and funded before June 2024 remain operational.

### What is blocked

The structural plan to combat homelessness required political decisions that the caretaker government could not take:

- **Housing First**: the programme, whose effectiveness is demonstrated by the scientific literature, could not be extended to new cohorts of beneficiaries
- **Permanent shelter places**: making emergency shelter places permanent beyond the winter scheme requires multi-year budget commitments
- **Transit housing**: no new agreements between COCOM and municipalities to create transitional housing
- **Multidisciplinary support**: no reinforcement of field teams (social workers, mediators, psychologists)

## Mental health: needs without answers

### A structural crisis

Mental health needs in Brussels have been rising structurally since the COVID-19 pandemic. Outpatient mental health services (Services de Sante Mentale -- SSM) face waiting lists of **several months** for a first consultation.

The most affected populations:

- **Young people** (18-25): anxiety, depression, social isolation
- **People in precarious situations**: precariousness is a major determinant of mental health
- **Isolated elderly people**: loneliness aggravates cognitive and depressive disorders
- **Migrants and asylum seekers**: trauma, post-migration stress, language barriers

### What is blocked

Under the caretaker government, COCOM could not launch any new mental health initiative:

- **No new mobile crisis teams** despite the saturation of existing services
- **No new community mental health centres**
- **No targeted prevention programmes** (youth, elderly, precarious environments)
- **No reinforcement** of existing SSMs whose teams are understaffed
- **No new agreements** with hospitals for psychiatric emergencies

Existing teams continued to work, but they were absorbing growing demand with constant resources.

## Nursing homes: an ignored demographic challenge

### The demographic reality

The ageing of the Brussels population is an established fact. The number of people over 80 increases each year, resulting in growing demand for places in nursing homes and care facilities.

### The frozen supply

Under the caretaker government:

- **No new accreditations** for nursing homes
- **No capacity extensions** for existing facilities
- **No refinancing** to improve the quality of care
- **No pricing policy** adapted to residents' purchasing power

Nursing home staff faced difficult working conditions: heavy workloads, salaries under pressure, high turnover. The freeze on investments worsened this situation.

## What continues to function

Despite the blockages, the system has not collapsed:

- **Iriscare** handles day-to-day management: payments to providers, file processing, quality inspections
- **Accredited services** continue to operate within the limits of their current resources
- **Bruss'Help** coordinates the homelessness sector with an operational winter scheme
- **The Observatory of Health and Social Affairs** continues to produce data and analyses
- **Existing mobile teams** in mental health continue their interventions

## Family allowances: a separate budgetary pressure

Family allowances in Brussels fall under **COCOM** competence since the 6th state reform. This transfer of powers entrusted Brussels with managing its own family benefits for over **308,000 children**.

In February 2026, the Brussels Parliament adopted a reform of family allowance management aimed at achieving savings. This reform includes a reduction of subsidies to family allowance funds and a gradual consolidation of operators towards Famiris.

**This reform is not a consequence of the caretaker government freeze.** It is a separate parliamentary decision, driven by COCOM's budgetary constraints. However, it adds to the difficulties of the Brussels social sector and amplifies the pressure on families.

## Conclusion: a social health system under strain

COCOM/GGC is the institution that covers the most fundamental needs of Brussels residents: health, assistance for the elderly, homelessness policy, mental health. The freeze on its investment and decision-making capacity had direct consequences for the most vulnerable populations.

Each month under the caretaker government:

- Waiting lists grew longer
- Existing facilities were stretched thinner
- Unmet needs accumulated
- The social debt deepened

The new government will need to adopt a multi-year budget, renew agreements with providers, accredit new facilities and launch the structural plans that the situation demands.
