Vivaqua is the public water operator in Brussels. As an intercommunal cooperative company, it is responsible for the production, distribution and treatment of drinking water for the 19 Brussels municipalities and certain surrounding municipalities.

The February 2026 government agreement provides for the financial consolidation of Vivaqua, whose budgetary situation requires a recovery plan. The operator also plays a central role in flood management and the modernisation of the sewerage network.
