## safe.brussels report: state of crime (2024 data)

The annual report of the Brussels Security Observatory (safe.brussels), published on 22 December 2025, provides a factual basis for assessing the RPD's priorities:

| Indicator | Data | Trend |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Recorded judicial offences | ~157,000/year | Stable over 10 years |
| Crime rate per 1,000 inhabitants | 131.01 (2024) | Declining (137.5 in 2014) |
| Drug-related offences | +33% | 2023→2024 |
| Firearm incidents | 92 (8 deaths) | Rising (3 deaths in 2023) |
| Homicides | 34 cases | +40% over 10 years |
| Sexual violence (rape) | +50% (police) | Over 10 years (~30% involve minors) |
| Theft and extortion | −19% | Since the 2000s |

**Reading**: overall crime is not "exploding" in Brussels -- the per-capita rate is declining thanks to population growth (+7.4%). But specific phenomena (drugs, firearms, sexual violence) are rising sharply, which justifies the RPD's targeted priorities (anti-drug commissioner, station security).

## RPD commitments

The Regional Policy Declaration of 13 February 2026 devotes an entire chapter to security, structured around several axes:

### Anti-drug efforts

- **Regional anti-drug commissioner** — dedicated authority, mirroring the federal mechanism
- **Integrated regional drug plan** — chain approach (prevention, harm reduction, enforcement)

### Station security

- **€10 million** investment for Midi and Nord stations
- Coordination with police zones and SNCB

### CCTV and police coordination

- Integration of local CCTV systems into the Federal Police central system
- SAFE.Brussels platform interconnected with CGPI
- Possible police zone mergers (subject to federal vote)
- Local neighbourhood policing stations

### SIAMU (fire service)

- **Two phases of staff reinforcement**
- Improved working conditions

### Other measures

- Dedicated recruitment pathway for security professions targeting Brussels residents
- Combating street harassment, juvenile delinquency, violence against women and children
- Combating drug trafficking and radicalisation

## First field action: Gare du Midi (17 February)

Three days after taking office, the minister-president made his first field visit to the **Gare du Midi** (Brussels South station), accompanied by the State Secretary for Urban Planning and the mayors of Anderlecht and Forest. His assessment: "there is room for improvement in coordination" between the actors present on site (local police zones, Federal Police, SNCB, Stib, communes).

This visit puts into practice the RPD's security priority and illustrates the coordination challenge underlying the **€10 million** earmarked for securing the Midi and Nord stations.

## Sources and methodology

The commitments documented above come from the official text of the RPD (chapter 7) and from concordant press sources covering the government agreement of 12 February 2026.
