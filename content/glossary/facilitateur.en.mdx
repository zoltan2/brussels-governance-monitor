The facilitator is a role specific to the Brussels government formation process, distinct from the traditional roles of formateur and informateur. While the formateur negotiates a complete government agreement and the informateur explores coalition possibilities, the facilitator receives a limited mandate: to resolve a specific deadlock preventing the formation from advancing.

Unlike at the federal level, where the King appoints formateurs and informateurs, at the Brussels regional level it is the president of Parliament who steers the process. The use of a facilitator is not provided for in institutional texts — it is an innovation born out of necessity in the face of the prolonged deadlock of 2024-2026.

In the context of the current crisis, a facilitator was appointed in August 2025 (Round 4) with the specific mission of resolving the question of linguistic balances in regional governance.
