## What happened

From 10 March 2025, the informateurs initiated a cycle of systematic consultations with all parties represented in the Brussels Parliament. Unlike the first-round consultations, which focused on the Arizona coalition parties, these consultations were open to all formations without exception.

## The method

The informateurs adopted a structured method:

1. **Individual consultations** — each party set out its priorities, red lines and acceptable partners
2. **Cross-consultations** — meetings between potentially compatible parties were arranged
3. **Configuration analysis** — the informateurs mathematically mapped all coalitions commanding a majority in both linguistic groups

## The results

The consultations revealed that the number of viable configurations was very limited. The dual linguistic majority constraint considerably narrowed the options. The informateurs identified one principal configuration:

- The expanded progressive coalition (PS-Ecolo-Groen-Les Engages-Vooruit-one.brussels) as the only formula combining both an overall majority and sufficient support in each linguistic group

The consultations also clarified each party's red lines, forming a valuable basis for the future formateur.
