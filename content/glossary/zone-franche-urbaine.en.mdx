The Urban Free Zone is a mechanism set out in the government agreement of February 2026 to relaunch economic activity at two strategic sites in the Region: the **Port of Brussels** (logistics and industrial vocation) and the **former Audi site in Forest** (industrial reconversion).

Three levers are planned: a fiscal lever (reduction of property tax and registration duties), an administrative lever (Fast-Track single desk) and a human lever (dedicated Actiris unit for the occupations in the zone).
