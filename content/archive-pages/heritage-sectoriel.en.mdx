_This page archives the sector-by-sector state of the Brussels-Capital Region at the end of 20 months of caretaker government (June 2024 — February 2026). This content has historical value: it will no longer be updated._

## Nonprofit sector

### A vital sector for Brussels

The nonprofit sector is one of the pillars of the Brussels social economy. With approximately **80,000 jobs**, it accounts for a significant share of employment in the Brussels-Capital Region. These workers operate in essential fields: socio-professional integration, personal assistance, early childhood care, mental health, support for people with disabilities, homeless services and integration of newcomers.

The sector's operations rely heavily on **multi-year agreements** between the Region and associations, **accreditations** granted by regional and community authorities, and **discretionary subsidies** that fund the launch or continuation of specific projects.

Between 9 June 2024 and 14 February 2026, while the government was in caretaker mode, all three mechanisms were frozen.

### Multi-year agreements: the heart of the problem

#### The mechanism

Multi-year agreements are funding contracts between the Region (or the Community Commissions) and nonprofit organisations. They typically cover a period of 3 to 5 years and define the missions, objectives and financial resources allocated.

These agreements form the backbone of nonprofit funding. They enable organisations to plan their activities, retain their teams and guarantee continuity of services to beneficiaries.

#### What is blocked

Dozens of multi-year agreements expired since June 2024. Under the caretaker government, the regional executive could not:

- **Renew** existing agreements that have expired
- **Negotiate** new agreements with organisations
- **Increase** financial allocations to account for inflation
- **Adapt** missions to the evolving needs of the population

Organisations whose agreements had expired generally continued to operate on the basis of tacit renewals or provisional funding. This created considerable **legal and financial uncertainty**: organisations did not know what resources they would have in the medium term.

#### The concrete consequences

According to the CBCS, several organisations have had to:

- **Postpone recruitment** planned in their staffing plans
- **Scale back programmes** due to lack of budgetary certainty
- **Turn away new beneficiaries** for want of guaranteed capacity
- **Freeze investments** in premises, equipment and digital tools

### Accreditations: the door closed to new services

#### The principle

Accreditation is the administrative act by which a public authority recognises that an organisation meets the conditions to carry out a specific activity. It determines access to public funding and, in some cases, is a legal requirement to operate.

#### The impact of the freeze

Between June 2024 and February 2026, **no new accreditation** was issued by the Brussels-Capital Region for nonprofit services. In practice:

- **New initiatives** by existing organisations could not be launched
- **New organisations** could not obtain the recognition needed to operate
- **Changes to accreditation** (capacity extensions, changes to target groups) were on hold
- **Transfers of accreditation** in the event of restructuring were complicated

This situation was particularly problematic in neighbourhoods where social needs were most acute. Field projects, sometimes prepared over months, remained shelved for lack of a political decision.

### Discretionary subsidies: the freeze on room for manoeuvre

Discretionary subsidies represent the portion of nonprofit funding that depends directly on discretionary political decisions. They fund one-off projects, experimental initiatives and responses to emerging needs.

Under the caretaker government, discretionary subsidy budgets were frozen. Only commitments made before June 2024 were honoured. This meant:

- **No new regional calls for proposals** for the nonprofit sector
- **No emergency funding** to respond to unforeseen social crises
- **No experimentation** with new models of social intervention
- **No ad hoc support** for organisations in financial difficulty

### What continues to function

#### Structural subsidies

Structural funding committed before June 2024 continues to be disbursed. Organisations with agreements still in force receive their funding instalments. Nonprofit workers' salaries are paid.

#### The federations

Sectoral federations play a crucial role in coordination and advocacy:

- **CBCS** (Brussels Council for Socio-Political Coordination) documents the impact of the crisis on the sector and coordinates demands
- **FeBISP** (Brussels Federation of Socio-Professional Integration Organisations) supports its members in managing the uncertainty
- **Brupartners** (the Region's Economic and Social Council) continues its advisory missions

#### Front-line services

Direct services to beneficiaries -- day centres, food aid, individual social support -- continue to operate with existing resources.

### The populations most affected

The freeze on the nonprofit sector primarily affected the most vulnerable populations in Brussels:

- **People on socio-professional integration pathways**, whose programmes are weakened
- **Single-parent families** who depend on local services
- **Newcomers** awaiting integration support
- **Homeless people** for whom new shelter places could not be created
- **Isolated elderly people** whose home care services are not being reinforced

### Outlook

The Brussels nonprofit sector has significant resilience, but it is not unlimited. The longer the caretaker period continued, the worse the structural consequences became:

- **Loss of expertise**: qualified workers leave the sector for more stable employment
- **Erosion of services**: programmes are gradually scaled back for lack of refinancing
- **Accumulation of needs**: populations not supported today will present heavier needs tomorrow
- **Financial fragility**: organisations exhaust their reserves and cash flow

Each month without a fully empowered government represented a social debt that the nonprofit sector will have to absorb, with resources that were not adapted to the reality of needs.

## Construction

### A sector at the crossroads of urban planning and the economy

The construction and real estate sector in Brussels is an essential link in the regional economy and urban transformation. It employs tens of thousands of workers and generates considerable economic activity, in both new construction and renovation of the existing building stock.

Brussels urban planning relies on strategic instruments -- Master Development Plans (PADs), regional urban planning permits and infrastructure public contracts -- all of which require fully empowered political decisions. The absence of a regional government between June 2024 and February 2026 froze all of these mechanisms.

### Master Development Plans: the strategic freeze

#### What is a PAD?

Master Development Plans are territorial planning tools created by the Brussels Code of Territorial Planning (CoBAT). They define the development framework for strategic zones at the regional level: land use, building density, public spaces, mobility and collective facilities.

A PAD commits the Region to a long-term vision for a neighbourhood or an urban hub. Its adoption is a major political act that requires a fully empowered government.

#### The frozen PADs

Several PADs are currently awaiting adoption or amendment:

- **PAD Heysel**: the redevelopment of the Heysel plateau, including the Neo project, was suspended. This project planned a congress centre, retail, housing and public spaces on one of the largest development sites in Brussels.
- **PAD Gare du Midi**: the transformation of the Gare du Midi area, one of the Region's most ambitious urban projects, could not proceed. The PAD was to provide a framework for the reconversion of this strategic zone between rail mobility and urban renewal.
- **PAD Delta**: the development of the Delta-Herrmann-Debroux site, linked to the dismantling of the viaduct and the creation of a new neighbourhood, is on hold.
- **PAD Casernes**: the conversion of the former Ixelles barracks site into a mixed-use neighbourhood was blocked.
- **PAD Mediapark**: the redevelopment of the RTBF/VRT site at Reyers was frozen.

Each of these PADs represents potential investments of hundreds of millions of euros and the creation of thousands of homes and jobs.

Source: perspective.brussels, PAD progress report, 2025.

#### The consequences of immobility

The freeze on PADs has cascading effects:

- **Legal uncertainty**: developers and investors did not know which regulatory framework would apply to their projects
- **Postponement of private investment**: without an adopted PAD, private projects that depended on the regulatory framework were suspended
- **Loss of attractiveness**: Brussels lost ground to other European cities that were moving forward on their urban projects
- **Deterioration of sites**: land awaiting redevelopment degraded or remained underused

### Regional public contracts: hundreds of millions on hold

#### The scale of the freeze

The Brussels-Capital Region is a major client for the construction sector. Its public contracts cover:

- **Mobility infrastructure**: tramways, tunnels, major cycle paths
- **Public buildings**: schools, sports facilities, cultural centres
- **Public spaces**: squares, parks, roads
- **Public housing**: programmes of the SLRB, Alliance Habitat

Under the caretaker government, only maintenance contracts and prior commitments were honoured. **New strategic contracts** -- those requiring a political decision -- were postponed.

The Confederation Construction Bruxelles-Capitale estimated that **hundreds of millions of euros** in public contracts were awaiting launch. This freeze directly affected the order books of Brussels construction firms.

#### The domino effect on employment

The construction sector operates on long project cycles (2 to 5 years from design to delivery). The freeze did not immediately translate into massive job losses -- ongoing sites continued -- but it created a **gap in the pipeline** that will be felt from 2026-2027 onwards:

- Engineering firms saw their commissions decline
- General contractors postponed their hiring plans
- Specialist subcontractors lost contracts
- Materials suppliers saw demand fall

### Urban planning permits: a two-tier system

#### What works

Urban planning permits falling under municipal authority continue to be issued. The 19 Brussels municipalities process permit applications for:

- Small and medium-scale projects
- Renovations of existing housing
- Local changes of use
- Neighbourhood retail fit-outs

Urban.brussels, the regional urban planning authority, continues to handle routine cases and requests for opinions.

#### What is blocked

Regional-scope urban planning permits -- those requiring a government decision -- were on hold:

- **Major mixed-use projects** (housing, offices, retail) on PAD sites
- **Large-scale public facilities** of regional scope
- **Strategic projects** linked to mobility or infrastructure
- **Derogations from the Regional Land Use Plan (PRAS)** for projects that deviate from existing zoning

### Ongoing construction sites: continuity assured

It is important to note that projects with all permits and funding in place before June 2024 continue normally:

- SLRB social housing construction sites already under way
- Renovation work on Brussels tunnels (Bruxelles Mobilite programme)
- Metro 3 construction (federal/STIB responsibility)
- Private projects with all permits granted

Construction did not come to a halt in Brussels. But the renewal of the project pipeline was frozen.

### Outlook: an accumulating urban debt

Urban planning is a long process. Decisions not taken today will have visible consequences in 5 to 10 years:

- **Housing not built**: each year of delay in adopting PADs pushes back the delivery of thousands of homes in a Region that desperately needs them
- **Ageing infrastructure**: investments not made in public facilities worsen the maintenance deficit
- **Slowed energy transition**: energy renovations of public buildings and new construction standards remain on hold
- **Regional competitiveness**: the accumulated delay in urban development affects Brussels' attractiveness for businesses and investors

The Confederation Construction Bruxelles-Capitale and perspective.brussels agree: each month of political immobility deepens an urban and economic debt from which the Region will take years to recover.

## Health and social

### COCOM: a key institution for social affairs in Brussels

The Joint Community Commission (COCOM), known in Dutch as the Gemeenschappelijke Gemeenschapscommissie (GGC), is the bi-communal institution responsible for personal assistance and health matters in Brussels. It covers so-called "bi-personal" matters: those that fall under neither the French Community nor the Flemish Community exclusively, but address all Brussels residents regardless of their linguistic affiliation.

Its scope of action is broad:

- **Nursing homes and care homes** (MRS)
- **Home care** for the elderly and dependent persons
- **Outpatient mental health services**
- **Homelessness policy** and emergency shelter
- **Early childhood care** (bi-communal component)
- **Services for people with disabilities**
- **Bi-communal hospitals**

Between June 2024 and February 2026, COCOM operated under a caretaker government and its budget was managed through provisional twelfths. Its executive arm, **Iriscare**, continued its core missions but could not commit any significant new expenditure.

### The freeze on accreditations: the door is closed

#### The accreditation mechanism

Accreditation is the act by which COCOM recognises that a care facility or service meets the required quality and safety standards. It determines access to public funding and, in most cases, is a legal requirement to operate.

#### Between June 2024 and February 2026: zero new accreditations

Under the caretaker government, COCOM could not issue **any new accreditation**. The consequences were direct:

- **No new nursing homes** despite the ageing of the Brussels population. The number of people over 80 in Brussels increased each year, but the supply of residential care was frozen.
- **No new day centres** for elderly or disabled persons
- **No new accredited home care services**
- **No capacity extensions** for existing facilities that are saturated

Facilities that submitted accreditation applications before June 2024 see their files on indefinite hold. Some have invested in premises, recruited staff and find themselves without official recognition.

Source: Iriscare, annual report 2024.

### Iriscare agreements: funding under pressure

#### The role of agreements

Iriscare, the public interest body that implements COCOM policy, funds care providers and facilities through multi-year agreements. These agreements define the missions, resources and quality objectives for each accredited service.

#### The refinancing blockage

Several multi-year agreements expired since June 2024. Under the caretaker government, Iriscare could not:

- **Renew** expired agreements under updated conditions
- **Revalue** rates to account for inflation and rising costs
- **Adapt** agreements to evolving needs (ageing, mental health, precariousness)
- **Fund** new pilot projects or experiments

Care providers continued to operate on the basis of tacit renewals under previous conditions. The gap between actual costs and funding widened each month.

#### Provisional twelfths

COCOM's budget was managed through provisional twelfths: each month, one twelfth of the previous year's budget was released. This mechanism guaranteed continuity of operations but prohibited:

- Any **budget increase**, even to cover indexation
- Any **new investment** in infrastructure or equipment
- Any **new policy**, even if it responds to a documented urgent need

### Homelessness policy: the permanent emergency

#### The figures

The count carried out by Bruss'Help in November 2024 recorded **7,134 homeless or without-a-home people** in Brussels. This figure has been rising steadily:

- 2018: 4,187 people
- 2020: 5,313 people
- 2022: 6,496 people
- 2024: 7,134 people

The increase is **70% in six years**. It affects all profiles: single people, families with children, young adults, elderly people, migrants in transit.

Source: Bruss'Help, count reports 2018-2024.

#### What works

- The **winter emergency scheme**: each year, additional emergency shelter places are opened during the winter period (November to March). This scheme is recurrent and funded from existing budgets.
- **Bruss'Help**: the coordinating organisation for the homelessness sector continues its missions of counting, referral and coordination between stakeholders.
- **Existing reception centres**: facilities accredited and funded before June 2024 remain operational.

#### What is blocked

The structural plan to combat homelessness required political decisions that the caretaker government could not take:

- **Housing First**: the programme, whose effectiveness is demonstrated by the scientific literature, could not be extended to new cohorts of beneficiaries
- **Permanent shelter places**: making emergency shelter places permanent beyond the winter scheme requires multi-year budget commitments
- **Transit housing**: no new agreements between COCOM and municipalities to create transitional housing
- **Multidisciplinary support**: no reinforcement of field teams (social workers, mediators, psychologists)

### Mental health: needs without answers

#### A structural crisis

Mental health needs in Brussels have been rising structurally since the COVID-19 pandemic. Outpatient mental health services (Services de Sante Mentale -- SSM) face waiting lists of **several months** for a first consultation.

The most affected populations:

- **Young people** (18-25): anxiety, depression, social isolation
- **People in precarious situations**: precariousness is a major determinant of mental health
- **Isolated elderly people**: loneliness aggravates cognitive and depressive disorders
- **Migrants and asylum seekers**: trauma, post-migration stress, language barriers

#### What is blocked

Under the caretaker government, COCOM could not launch any new mental health initiative:

- **No new mobile crisis teams** despite the saturation of existing services
- **No new community mental health centres**
- **No targeted prevention programmes** (youth, elderly, precarious environments)
- **No reinforcement** of existing SSMs whose teams are understaffed
- **No new agreements** with hospitals for psychiatric emergencies

Existing teams continued to work, but they were absorbing growing demand with constant resources.

### Nursing homes: an ignored demographic challenge

#### The demographic reality

The ageing of the Brussels population is an established fact. The number of people over 80 increases each year, resulting in growing demand for places in nursing homes and care facilities.

#### The frozen supply

Under the caretaker government:

- **No new accreditations** for nursing homes
- **No capacity extensions** for existing facilities
- **No refinancing** to improve the quality of care
- **No pricing policy** adapted to residents' purchasing power

Nursing home staff faced difficult working conditions: heavy workloads, salaries under pressure, high turnover. The freeze on investments worsened this situation.

### What continues to function

Despite the blockages, the system has not collapsed:

- **Iriscare** handles day-to-day management: payments to providers, file processing, quality inspections
- **Accredited services** continue to operate within the limits of their current resources
- **Bruss'Help** coordinates the homelessness sector with an operational winter scheme
- **The Observatory of Health and Social Affairs** continues to produce data and analyses
- **Existing mobile teams** in mental health continue their interventions

### Family allowances: a separate budgetary pressure

Family allowances in Brussels fall under **COCOM** competence since the 6th state reform. This transfer of powers entrusted Brussels with managing its own family benefits for over **308,000 children**.

In February 2026, the Brussels Parliament adopted a reform of family allowance management aimed at achieving savings. This reform includes a reduction of subsidies to family allowance funds and a gradual consolidation of operators towards Famiris.

**This reform is not a consequence of the caretaker government freeze.** It is a separate parliamentary decision, driven by COCOM's budgetary constraints. However, it adds to the difficulties of the Brussels social sector and amplifies the pressure on families.

Source: La Libre Belgique, 7 February 2026; Brussels Parliament, draft ordinance DeFI/Anders/PS.

### Conclusion: a social health system under strain

COCOM/GGC is the institution that covers the most fundamental needs of Brussels residents: health, assistance for the elderly, homelessness policy, mental health. The freeze on its investment and decision-making capacity had direct consequences for the most vulnerable populations.

Each month under the caretaker government:

- Waiting lists grew longer
- Existing facilities were stretched thinner
- Unmet needs accumulated
- The social debt deepened

The new government will need to adopt a multi-year budget, renew agreements with providers, accredit new facilities and launch the structural plans that the situation demands.

## Horeca

### An emblematic sector for Brussels

The horeca sector (hotels, restaurants, cafes) is one of the most visible parts of the Brussels economy. With approximately **9,000 establishments** and **35,000 direct jobs**, it constitutes a major economic pillar of the Brussels-Capital Region. The sector is also intimately linked to the city's cultural identity, its tourist appeal and the vitality of its neighbourhoods.

The Brussels horeca sector depends on several regional mechanisms: **seasonal employment subsidies**, **urban planning and terrace permits**, the **tourism policy** led by Visit.brussels, and **sectoral premiums** managed by Actiris and hub.brussels.

Between 9 June 2024 and 14 February 2026, the caretaker regional government could no longer take new decisions in these areas.

### Subsidies for seasonal workers: a critical shortfall

#### The mechanism

Brussels horeca is characterised by strong seasonality. The summer months, festive periods and major events (European summits, international conferences) generate peaks in activity that require hiring seasonal workers. The Brussels-Capital Region had developed specific support schemes for these temporary hires.

#### What is blocked

Under the caretaker government, no new seasonal employment support scheme could be launched. Existing budgets were frozen at pre-June 2024 levels. In practice:

- **No new subsidies** for hiring seasonal workers in 2025 and 2026
- **No adjustment** of amounts for inflation and rising labour costs
- **No targeted programmes** for hard-to-employ jobseekers in the horeca sector
- **No specific support** for the sector's digital transition

According to Federation Horeca Brussels, this situation forced many establishments to limit their seasonal hiring or offer less favourable contracts to workers.

Source: Federation Horeca Brussels, communication on seasonal employment, 2025.

### Terrace permits: urban policy on hold

#### The stakes

Terraces are an essential element of the business model of many Brussels cafes and restaurants. They are also an issue of urban planning, public space sharing and quality of life in neighbourhoods.

The granting of terrace permits and approval of extensions fell under political decisions that could not be taken under the caretaker government, except for matters of day-to-day management.

#### The consequences

- **No new terrace permits** for recently opened establishments
- **No extension** of existing terraces into new spaces
- **No regularisation** of provisional arrangements inherited from the COVID period
- **No adaptation** of regulations to new urban realities (pedestrianisation, cycle lanes)

Operators wishing to install or enlarge a terrace had to wait for a fully empowered government to be formed.

Source: Brulocalis, note on urban planning permits under a caretaker government, 2025.

### Tourism policy: a strategy on hold

#### The context

Brussels welcomed approximately **8.5 million overnight stays** in 2024, up from the post-COVID years. The Region has a dedicated body, **Visit.brussels**, responsible for tourism promotion and sector support.

#### What is suspended

The regional strategic tourism plan, which defines priorities and investments for the development of tourism in Brussels, was suspended. Visit.brussels continued its routine promotion activities but could not:

- **Launch major new campaigns** requiring additional budgets
- **Develop new international partnerships** committing the Region
- **Fund new tourist reception infrastructure**
- **Adapt the strategy** to changes in the international tourism market

Source: Visit.brussels, activity report 2024; hub.brussels, Brussels economic observatory.

### Sectoral employment premiums

Regional employment premiums specific to the horeca sector, managed by Actiris, were an important lever for encouraging recruitment in a sector that struggles to attract staff. Under the caretaker government:

- **Premium amounts** could not be increased
- **Eligibility criteria** could not be broadened to new target groups
- **Specific support programmes** could not be strengthened
- **Coordination** between Actiris, Forem and VDAB for commuting workers was frozen

Source: Actiris, annual report 2024.

### What continues to function

#### Existing support

Employment support programmes committed before June 2024 continue to be implemented. Horeca employers already receiving premiums or subsidies continue to receive them under the agreed terms.

#### Basic tourism promotion

Visit.brussels continues its promotion activities within its existing operating budget. Campaigns planned before June 2024 are being carried out normally.

#### Support services

Actiris and hub.brussels continue to support jobseekers and entrepreneurs in the horeca sector with existing resources.

### Impact on the ground

The freeze on regional mechanisms had direct consequences for the sector's daily life:

- **Reduced seasonal employment**: fewer seasonal positions opened during peak periods
- **Postponed investments**: renovation and expansion projects were on hold
- **Weakened competitiveness**: Brussels establishments were disadvantaged compared to neighbouring regions that adapted their policies
- **Stagnating tourist appeal**: without new initiatives, Brussels lost ground to other European capitals

### Outlook

The Brussels horeca sector demonstrated its resilience during the health crisis. But the combination of persistent inflation, structural recruitment difficulties and the absence of an active regional policy weakened a sector already under pressure.

Each tourist season without adapted support represented lost revenue for establishments, a missed employment opportunity for workers and a weakening of Brussels' economic attractiveness.

## Culture

### Brussels, a cultural capital under pressure

Brussels occupies a unique place in the European cultural landscape. As a bilingual city at the heart of Europe, it is home to approximately **300 subsidised cultural institutions** and generates some **15,000 jobs** in the cultural sector. Theatres, museums, art centres, concert halls, galleries, dance companies and artistic collectives make the capital an internationally recognised creative hub.

The funding of this cultural vitality relies on a system involving **several levels of government** that must be clearly distinguished:

- **Community (FWB, Flemish Community)**: the majority of cultural subsidies in Brussels. Multi-year programme contracts, accreditations and structural funding for major institutions fall under Community competence. This level **continues to operate**, but without indexation of funding envelopes.
- **Regional (Brussels-Capital Region)**: co-funding of cultural projects, one-off subsidies, regional accreditations, inter-level coordination. This level has been **frozen** since 9 June 2024.
- **Municipal**: municipal subsidies for local initiatives, provision of venues and infrastructure. This level continues but some communes have made budget cuts.

Between 9 June 2024 and 14 February 2026, the **specifically regional** mechanisms were frozen. Community competences continued but were progressively eroding due to non-indexation.

### Cultural subsidies: the heart of the problem

#### The mechanism

The Brussels-Capital Region devotes an annual budget of approximately **EUR 120 million** to cultural policies, directly or through the community commissions. These funds finance the operations of cultural institutions, artistic programming, artist residencies, cultural mediation projects and support for emerging creators.

#### What is blocked

Under the caretaker government, the entire system of regional cultural funding was frozen:

- **No new subsidies** for emerging cultural projects
- **No revaluation** of existing allocations to account for inflation
- **No additional support** for structures in financial difficulty
- **No regional calls for proposals** for artistic creation

Institutions receiving structural subsidies committed before June 2024 continue to receive them. But every new application goes unanswered.

Source: RAB/BKO, note on the impact of caretaker mode on the Brussels cultural sector, 2025.

### Festivals: a nuanced situation

#### The Kunstenfestivaldesarts

The **Kunstenfestivaldesarts**, an internationally renowned performing arts festival, is primarily funded by the **Federation Wallonia-Brussels** and the **Flemish Community** (community competence). These multi-year subsidies **continue to be disbursed**, even without a regional government. The festival is therefore **not directly threatened** by the regional crisis.

However, the regional co-funding share could not be renewed or increased under the caretaker government, which limited room for development.

#### Events more directly affected

Festivals and events that rely more heavily on **specifically regional** funding are more exposed:

- Events linked to Brussels heritage (regional competence)
- Intercultural and bilingual events characteristic of Brussels
- The Zinneke Parade and Image de Bruxelles festivals, whose regional funding is significant

#### The concrete consequences

- **Postponed ambitious projects**: productions requiring regional co-production are suspended
- **Loss of international partnerships**: foreign institutions hesitate to commit without regional co-funding guarantees
- **Increased precarity for artists**: fewer commissions and residencies funded at the regional level

Source: RAB/BKO, policy watch, February 2026; COCOF, budget report 2025.

### Bookstores and the book trade in Brussels

#### An economically fragile sector

The **Press and Books** sub-sector is the only segment of the cultural and creative industries (CCI) in decline in Brussels: **-3%** of enterprises over ten years, while the overall CCI sector is growing (+21% in jobs since 2013). It nevertheless accounts for **4,200 enterprises** and **EUR 1.7 billion** in turnover (source: hub.brussels, CCI study 2023).

Brussels has approximately **30 independent bookstores** of small to medium size. Their average profit margin is approximately **1%** of turnover -- an extremely precarious balance. French-language bookstores additionally lose 0.5% margin on books imported from France (VAT 5.5% in France vs 6% in Belgium).

#### Filigranes: near-bankruptcy and revival

**Filigranes**, Belgium's largest bookstore (accounting for roughly one-tenth of all physical book purchases in the country), narrowly avoided bankruptcy in 2024 after two restructurings in 18 months. Acquired in December 2024 by businessman Mehmet Sandurac (EUR 305,000 + EUR 1.5 million investment), it reopened on 23 April 2025 at Boulevard de Waterloo (Mayfair) with 30 employees and ~150,000 titles.

#### Chain reorganisations

**Club** (Standaard Boekhandel subsidiary) underwent a reorganisation in 2024. The **Club Flagey** and **Club Dockx** stores in Brussels were transferred to Press Shop and More. The brand was renamed "Librairie Club" in 2025. **Furet du Nord** went bankrupt in Belgium (Louvain-la-Neuve, Namur).

#### The Brussels Book Fair

The **54th Brussels Book Fair** (Tour and Taxis, March 2025) attracted a record **85,000 visitors** (+13% vs 2024), with 1,200 authors, 300 exhibitors and 500 publishing houses represented. The 55th edition is planned for 26-29 March 2026.

#### Federal threat: VAT at 9%

The proposed Arizona federal coalition plans a VAT increase on books from **6% to 9%**. The French-language booksellers' union calls the measure "catastrophic" for a network operating on 1% margins. Such an increase would encourage cross-border online purchasing at the expense of physical bookstores.

Sources: hub.brussels (CCI study 2023), RTBF (Brussels bookstores, 2024; Book Fair 2025), SLFB (bookstores report 2024-2025), Actualitte.

### Community centres: the local cultural fabric

#### The role of the centres

Cultural and community centres form the local cultural network across the 19 Brussels municipalities. They offer spaces for creation, dissemination and artistic practice accessible to all audiences, and play an essential role in neighbourhood social cohesion.

#### The impact of the freeze

Allocations to regional community centres could not be increased or redirected. In practice:

- **No refinancing** to offset inflation of operating costs (energy, rent, equipment)
- **No new missions** entrusted to the centres (digital mediation, reaching new audiences)
- **No investment** in the renovation of local cultural infrastructure
- **No adaptation** of programming to the changing needs of neighbourhoods

Centres that had been operating on tight budgets for years saw their room for manoeuvre shrink further.

Source: COCOF, state of play of cultural centres, 2025; VGC, annual report 2024.

### Cultural accreditations: the door closed to new initiatives

Under the caretaker government, no new accreditation could be issued to cultural structures. This blocked:

- The **official recognition** of new companies or artistic collectives
- **Access to public funding** for young structures
- **Changes to accreditation** for institutions wishing to expand their activities
- The **creation of new cultural venues** requiring regional accreditation

Source: French Community Commission, report on cultural accreditations, 2025.

### What continues to function

#### Community funding (the majority)

The **majority of cultural subsidies** in Brussels come from the community level: the Federation Wallonia-Brussels and the Flemish Community fully exercise their cultural competences, independently of the regional crisis. Multi-year programme contracts are maintained. However, the absence of indexation is causing a **progressive erosion** of real funding, estimated at several percentage points per year.

#### Ongoing regional structural funding

Regional structural subsidies committed before June 2024 continue to be disbursed. Beneficiary institutions receive their allocations under existing agreements.

#### Artistic autonomy

Cultural institutions with their own reserves, box office revenues, community funding or private funding continued to programme their seasons. Artistic creation did not stop, but complementary regional resources were frozen.

### The populations most affected

The freeze on regional cultural mechanisms affected people unevenly:

- **Young creators** who could not access their first public funding
- **Emerging companies** whose projects remain shelved
- **Audiences in working-class neighbourhoods** who depend on community centres for access to culture
- **Intermittent cultural workers** whose work opportunities are shrinking
- **Artists not affiliated with major institutions**, who are more dependent on one-off subsidies

### What BGM does not say

This card **does not say** that all cultural funding in Brussels was blocked. The majority of cultural subsidies come from the community level (Federation Wallonia-Brussels, Flemish Community), where multi-year commitments continue. The regional crisis affects the **specifically regional** levers -- co-funding, regional accreditations, inter-level coordination -- and not the entire system.

Furthermore, the cultural sector faces pressures from **other levels of government** that are not linked to the regional crisis: non-indexation of community programme contracts, federal budget cuts to national institutions, VAT increases on leisure, reductions to Creative Europe at the European level. These factors accumulate alongside the regional freeze but do not stem from it.

### Outlook

The Brussels cultural sector survived the health crisis thanks to emergency mechanisms. But the institutional crisis was different: it did not trigger exceptional support measures. The freeze was silent, gradual and cumulative.

Each season without an active cultural policy represented an impoverishment of the offering, a loss of talent and a weakening of Brussels' international reputation as a cultural capital.

## Transport

### A lifeline for Brussels mobility

The Brussels public transport network, managed by **STIB-MIVB**, forms the backbone of mobility in the Brussels-Capital Region. With approximately **430 million journeys per year**, 4 metro lines, 18 tram lines and 54 bus lines, STIB carries hundreds of thousands of Brussels residents, commuters and visitors daily.

The operation and development of this network depend on regional political decisions: the **multi-year investment plan**, **budgetary arbitrations** on major infrastructure projects, **fare policy** and the **planning** of new lines.

Between 9 June 2024 and 14 February 2026, these levers were frozen. The network operated, but it could no longer evolve.

### Metro 3: a project that advances, decisions that wait

#### The state of play

The **Metro 3** project is the largest transport infrastructure construction project in Brussels history. It provides for the construction of a new metro line linking Gare du Nord to Bordet (Evere), with seven new stations. The total cost is estimated at approximately **EUR 3.2 billion**, co-financed by the Brussels-Capital Region and the federal government through **Beliris**.

Civil engineering works continue in accordance with contracts committed before June 2024. The tunnel boring machines advance, stations are being excavated, and workers are on site.

#### What is blocked (regional level)

However, key political decisions remained suspended:

- **Budgetary arbitrations**: cost overruns could not be the subject of political decisions
- **Timeline**: any adjustments to the commissioning date could not be validated
- **Southern extension**: any decision on extending the line to southern Brussels was deferred
- **Intermodal integration**: decisions on connecting Metro 3 with other networks (SNCB, TEC, De Lijn) required political arbitration

#### What continues (federal level)

**Beliris**, the federal cooperation agreement that co-finances Metro 3, continued to operate independently of the regional crisis. Federal investment decisions, public contracts managed by Beliris and the technical monitoring of the construction site continued. The project therefore advanced on its federal component, but the regional governance component was frozen.

The risk was that of a construction site operating at **two speeds**: the federal component (Beliris) that decided and invested, and the regional component (STIB/Region) that could no longer arbitrate the strategic choices within its remit.

Source: Beliris, Metro 3 progress report, 2025; STIB, annual report 2024.

### STIB investment plan: the strategic freeze

#### The mechanism

STIB operates on the basis of a **management contract** with the Brussels-Capital Region, which defines public service obligations, quality targets and financial resources. This contract is accompanied by a **multi-year investment plan** that programmes the purchase of new rolling stock, station renovation, network extension and infrastructure modernisation.

#### What is suspended

The multi-year investment plan could not be renewed or adapted. The consequences were gradual:

- **No ordering of new rolling stock** beyond existing contracts
- **No renovation** of ageing stations outside of already-launched projects
- **No investment** in the digital modernisation of the network (ticketing, real-time passenger information)
- **No adaptation** of services to Brussels' demographic changes

Rolling stock aged, stations deteriorated, and needs grew with the increasing Brussels population.

Source: STIB, investment plan 2020-2025; Brussels Mobility, regional mobility plan.

### New lines and frequencies: a frozen offering

#### The need

Several rapidly expanding neighbourhoods (Heysel, Tour and Taxis, renovated European quarter) require an adaptation of the public transport offering. Projects for new tram lines, bus route extensions and increased frequencies were under study before June 2024.

#### What is blocked

- **No creation** of new bus or tram lines
- **No increase** in frequencies on saturated lines
- **No route changes** to serve new neighbourhoods
- **No decision** on dedicated tramway projects

Users in poorly served neighbourhoods continued to endure long journey times and multiple connections.

Source: Brussels Mobility, new lines feasibility study, 2024.

### Fares and accessibility

Decisions on STIB network fares were also frozen:

- **No changes** to social fares for vulnerable populations
- **No extension** of free travel to new user categories
- **No fare harmonisation** with other operators (TEC, De Lijn, SNCB)
- **No additional investment** in accessibility for persons with reduced mobility (PRM)

Source: STIB, fare schedule 2024; Brussels Mobility, accessibility plan.

### What continues to function

#### Ongoing operations

STIB continues to transport hundreds of thousands of passengers daily. Timetables are maintained, lines operate, and staff are in place. Existing service quality is preserved.

#### Ongoing construction

All projects launched before June 2024 continue normally. Metro 3 advances, planned station renovations are being carried out, and ordered rolling stock is being delivered.

#### Maintenance

Network maintenance (tracks, stations, rolling stock) continues to be carried out within existing budgets.

### Impact on users

The freeze on decision-making had tangible consequences for users:

- **Saturation** of lines during peak hours with no prospect of short-term improvement
- **Ageing** of rolling stock on certain lines
- **Lack of adequate service** in newly developing neighbourhoods
- **Stagnation** of social fare options despite rising cost of living

### Outlook

Brussels public transport faced a paradox: a mega-project (Metro 3) that advanced mechanically, but an overall system that could not adapt to the changing needs of the city. Each month without political decisions widened the gap between the transport offering and user demand.

The Metro 3 question perfectly illustrated this tension: the tunnel boring machines dug, but the decisions that determined service quality, intermodality and the final cost of the project awaited a fully empowered government.

## Education

### Education and training: a major regional issue

Education and vocational training are a central issue for the Brussels-Capital Region. With a **youth unemployment rate of approximately 28%**, a dense school network of **700 schools** and a regional vocational training body (**Bruxelles Formation**) that serves **18,000 trainees per year**, education and training policies are essential levers for socio-economic integration.

In Belgium, compulsory education falls under the competence of the Communities (French, Flemish, German-speaking). However, the Brussels-Capital Region exercises its own competences in **vocational training**, **school infrastructure**, **educational coordination** and **bilingual projects**. These competences are directly affected by the caretaker freeze.

### Bruxelles Formation: programmes on hold

#### The role

**Bruxelles Formation** is the regional public body for vocational training. It offers qualifying training in dozens of occupations -- construction, digital, languages, management, healthcare -- aimed at Brussels jobseekers. The body works in partnership with Actiris, VDAB Brussels and numerous accredited training providers.

#### What is blocked

Existing training programmes were being continued, but no new programme could be launched:

- **No new training courses** in sectors with labour shortages (digital, green transition, healthcare)
- **No adaptation** of existing programmes to labour market changes
- **No new partnerships** with private training providers
- **No strengthening** of skills validation mechanisms
- **No increase** in the number of places on the most in-demand courses

For a region where youth unemployment exceeds 28%, the freeze on training policy constituted a structural handicap.

Source: Bruxelles Formation, activity report 2024; Actiris, Brussels labour market overview 2025.

### School infrastructure: blocked renovations

#### The situation

The Brussels school estate is ageing. Many buildings date from the early 20th century and require significant renovation: thermal insulation, safety standard compliance, PRM accessibility, digital equipment. **Perspective.brussels** estimates that over **100 school buildings** require priority intervention.

#### What is suspended

School renovation projects that had not been formally committed (public procurement launched, budgets allocated) before June 2024 were blocked:

- **No new renovation projects** financed by the Region
- **No investment** in the energy efficiency of Brussels schools
- **No fire safety upgrades** for the oldest buildings
- **No creation** of new school places in demographically growing neighbourhoods

The municipalities, which manage part of the school estate, were also constrained in their investments by the regional budget situation.

Source: Perspective.brussels, school facilities monitoring, 2025; IBSA, school demographic data.

### Bilingual education: suspended pilot projects

#### The context

Brussels is an officially bilingual region (French-Dutch), but in practice bilingualism is declining. Knowledge of Dutch is nevertheless a considerable asset on the Brussels job market, and bilingual education is a lever for social cohesion in a linguistically diverse city.

Before June 2024, the Region had launched consultations and pilot projects aimed at strengthening bilingual education, in collaboration with the Communities. These initiatives were suspended.

#### What is blocked

- **No launch** of new bilingual education pilot projects
- **No regional funding** for language bridging initiatives in schools
- **No enhanced coordination** between the French Community and the Flemish Community on the bilingual school offering
- **No support** for schools wishing to develop immersion programmes

Source: Brupartners, opinion on bilingual education in Brussels, 2024; VGC, report on Dutch in Brussels.

### Subsidies for innovative education projects

Regional subsidy budgets for innovative education projects -- digital learning in schools, tackling school dropout, youth employment insertion -- were frozen:

- **No new regional calls for proposals** in the education field
- **No funding** for pedagogical experiments
- **No additional support** for schools in priority neighbourhoods
- **No investment** in digital educational tools

Source: COCOF, report on education policies, 2025; Bruxelles Formation, strategic note 2025.

### What continues to function

#### Existing training

Training programmes launched before June 2024 continue to be delivered. Enrolled trainees continue their training pathways. Bruxelles Formation and its partners ensure service continuity.

#### Community education

The French and Flemish Communities continue to fully exercise their competences in compulsory education. Schools operate, teachers are in place, and curricula are delivered.

#### Committed projects

School renovation projects whose public procurement had been launched before June 2024 continue normally.

### The populations most affected

The freeze on education and training mechanisms primarily affected:

- **Young jobseekers** who could not find training suited to their career plans
- **Workers in career transition** who could not access new qualifying programmes
- **Pupils in dilapidated schools** studying in deteriorating material conditions
- **Families in growing neighbourhoods** who lack school places
- **Non-bilingual Brussels youth** whose job market prospects are reduced

### Outlook

Education and training constitute the most cost-effective long-term investment for a region facing high structural unemployment. Each month without an active training policy represented skills not acquired, jobs not filled and young people remaining distant from the labour market.

The freeze on school renovations also had long-term consequences: buildings deteriorated, renovation costs increased and learning conditions worsened for pupils.

## Digital

### A strategic sector for the future of Brussels

The technology and digital sector is a growing pillar of the Brussels economy. With approximately **40,000 direct jobs** and an ecosystem of **over 1,200 startups**, Brussels has positioned itself as a digital hub in Europe. The presence of European institutions and international organisations strengthens the Region's attractiveness for technology companies.

The sector depends on several regional mechanisms: the **Smart City strategy**, **digital inclusion subsidies**, **startup incentives** managed by Innoviris and hub.brussels, and the **digitalisation of public services**.

Between 9 June 2024 and 14 February 2026, the caretaker regional government could no longer take new structural decisions in these areas.

### Smart City strategy: an interrupted vision

#### The mechanism

Brussels' Smart City strategy aimed to integrate digital technologies into urban management: smart mobility, data management, connected public services, digital citizen participation. This framework plan defined investments and priorities to make Brussels a smart and inclusive city.

#### What is blocked

Under the caretaker government, no new strategic initiatives could be launched. In practice:

- **No new smart city projects** (urban sensors, open data, participatory platforms)
- **No adaptation** of the plan to rapid technological developments (artificial intelligence, cybersecurity)
- **No new public-private partnerships** in the digital domain
- **No funding** for new regional digital infrastructure

Source: Brussels-Capital Region, Smart City plan; hub.brussels, digital economy observatory, 2025.

### Digital inclusion: vulnerable populations left waiting

#### The stakes

Brussels has a significant proportion of residents in situations of digital vulnerability: elderly people, low-skilled individuals, newcomers. Regional digital inclusion programmes fund training, public digital spaces and support schemes.

#### What is frozen

- **No new calls for projects** for organisations active in digital inclusion
- **No expansion** of public digital spaces in disadvantaged neighbourhoods
- **No adaptation** of programmes to new needs (mandatory online administration, post-COVID digital divide)
- **No strengthening** of partnerships with CPAS/OCMW social welfare centres and municipalities

Grassroots organisations such as BeCode reported a growing need for digital training that existing resources could not meet.

Source: BeCode, activity report 2024; King Baudouin Foundation, digital inclusion barometer, 2025.

### Startup incentives: a weakened ecosystem

#### The context

The Brussels startup ecosystem developed thanks to a range of regional instruments: pre-activity grants, Innoviris innovation premiums, hub.brussels support, and Region-backed incubators.

#### Consequences of the freeze

- **No new programmes** for innovation support adapted to current technological trends
- **No revaluation** of grant and premium amounts against inflation
- **No new agreements** with incubators and accelerators
- **No regional strategy** for attracting international technology talent

Innoviris continued to fund projects approved before June 2024, but could not launch new large-scale calls for projects.

Source: Innoviris, annual report 2024; hub.brussels, Brussels startup barometer, 2025.

### Digitalisation of public services: modernisation on pause

Brussels' regional administrations had begun an extensive digitalisation programme. Under the caretaker government:

- **New digitalisation projects** (single digital window, regional digital identity) were suspended
- **Major IT public procurement** could not be launched
- **Digital training** for civil servants was limited to existing programmes
- **Interoperability** between the systems of different Brussels administrations stagnated

Source: CIRB (Centre for IT for the Brussels Region), activity report 2024.

### What continues to function

#### Technology companies

Technology companies established in Brussels continued their activities normally. The private digital market was not directly affected by the caretaker government, although the absence of an active regional policy reduced the territory's attractiveness.

#### University research

Brussels universities continue their research programmes in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and big data. Projects funded by European programmes (Horizon Europe) are unaffected.

#### Existing digital services

Regional digital platforms and services already deployed continue to function with existing maintenance budgets.

### Impact on the ground

The freeze on regional mechanisms had concrete consequences for the digital sector:

- **Weakened startup ecosystem**: without new incentives, Brussels startups are disadvantaged compared to Flemish and Walloon ecosystems
- **Widening digital divide**: vulnerable populations lack training and support
- **Technological lag**: the Smart City strategy falls behind other European capitals
- **Declining attractiveness**: international digital talent turns to regions offering more active support

### Outlook

The Brussels digital sector has structural assets: the European presence, a quality university pool, cultural diversity conducive to innovation. But these assets are not sufficient without an active regional policy of support and development.

Each month without a regional digital strategy represented accumulated delay compared to cities such as Amsterdam, Berlin or Lisbon, which were investing heavily in their digital transformation.

## Environment

### A sector at the heart of Brussels' challenges

Environment and climate are central challenges for the Brussels-Capital Region. With high urban density, an ageing building stock and European climate targets to meet, Brussels faces major environmental challenges: energy renovation of buildings, air quality, water management and biodiversity conservation.

Regional environmental policy relies on several key mechanisms: **Renolution premiums**, the **Blue Deal** for water management, the **air quality action plan** and the **Nature Plan** for biodiversity. These programmes are primarily led by Brussels Environment and its partners.

Between 9 June 2024 and 14 February 2026, the caretaker regional government could no longer take new structural decisions in these areas.

### Renolution premiums: energy renovation stalls

#### The mechanism

The Renolution programme is the Region's primary lever for encouraging the energy renovation of buildings. It offers premiums for roof and facade insulation, replacement of oil boilers, installation of solar panels and heat pumps. This programme is essential for meeting regional climate targets.

#### What is blocked

Under the caretaker government, the Renolution programme could no longer accept new applications. Files submitted before June 2024 continued to be processed, but:

- **No new premium applications** are accepted
- **No adjustment** of premium amounts for construction cost inflation
- **No expansion** of the programme to new types of work
- **No simplification** of administrative procedures promised by the Region

With approximately **75% of Brussels buildings** rated EPC D or lower, the need for energy renovation remains massive.

Source: Brussels Environment, Renolution review 2024; EPC certificates, regional statistics, 2025.

### Blue Deal: water management suspended

#### The stakes

Brussels faces a dual water challenge: increasingly frequent flooding episodes during heavy rainfall, and the need for sustainable water resource management in the context of climate change. The Blue Deal, an interregional water management plan, provided for investments in stormwater infrastructure, surface de-sealing and protection of flood-prone areas.

#### What is frozen

- **No new projects** for surface de-sealing or storm basins
- **No funding** for new stormwater management infrastructure
- **No update** to the mapping of flood risk zones
- **No new partnerships** with municipalities for local water management

Source: Brussels Environment, water management plan 2022-2027; Vivaqua, annual report 2024.

### Air quality: measures on hold

#### The context

Air quality in Brussels remains a major public health issue. The low-emission zone (LEZ), established in 2018, progressively restricts access for the most polluting vehicles. The regional air quality action plan provided for a gradual tightening of standards and complementary measures.

#### What is suspended

- The **tightening schedule** for the low-emission zone could not be accelerated or modified
- **New measures** to reduce air pollution could not be adopted
- The **enhanced monitoring plan** planned for 2025-2026 could not be launched
- **Subsidies to individuals** for replacing polluting vehicles were frozen

Source: Brussels Environment, air quality report 2024; regional Air-Climate-Energy plan.

### Biodiversity: the green network on pause

The Nature Plan of the Brussels Region aimed to strengthen urban biodiversity and develop the green network (ecological corridors, neighbourhood green spaces, green roofs). Under the caretaker government:

- **New projects** for creating green spaces are suspended
- **Neighbourhood contracts** incorporating a biodiversity component could not be launched
- The **management plan** for Brussels' Natura 2000 areas could not be updated
- **Subsidies** for citizen greening projects were frozen

Source: Brussels Environment, Nature Plan 2016-2020 (extended); biodiversity report 2024.

### What continues to function

#### Environmental permits

Environmental permits already issued remain valid. Renewal applications and routine administrative procedures continue to be processed by Brussels Environment.

#### Environmental monitoring

Brussels Environment continues its monitoring missions: air quality measurement stations, watercourse monitoring, management of regional green spaces and forests (Sonian Forest, regional parks).

#### Low-emission zone

The LEZ continues to operate according to the schedule established before June 2024. Controls and sanctions remain in force.

### Impact on the ground

The freeze on environmental mechanisms had direct and measurable consequences:

- **Delayed climate targets**: the CO2 reduction commitments for 2030 are becoming difficult to achieve
- **Slowed energy renovation**: property owners could no longer access Renolution premiums for new projects
- **Flood risks**: without new investments in water management, Brussels' vulnerability to heavy rainfall increases
- **Public health**: the delay in strengthening air quality measures directly affects residents' health

### Outlook

Environmental policy is a domain where lost time is difficult to make up. Each year without an active energy renovation programme increased the Region's climate debt. The European Green Deal targets were not suspended by Brussels' political crisis.

The new regional government will need not only to relaunch the frozen programmes, but also to compensate for the accumulated delay to meet Belgium's climate commitments.

## Commerce

### Local commerce, the vital fabric of Brussels

Commerce is an essential pillar of the Brussels economy and neighbourhood life. With approximately **60,000 commercial establishments** and **55,000 direct jobs** in retail, this sector runs through all 19 municipalities of the Region. From the major shopping streets (Rue Neuve, Avenue Louise, Chaussee d'Ixelles) to small neighbourhood shops, the Brussels commercial fabric is dense and diverse.

Regional commerce policy relies on several mechanisms: **revitalisation subsidies**, the **night economy strategy**, **commercial regulation** and the **regional commerce action plan**. These instruments are primarily managed by hub.brussels and Atrium Brussels.

Between 9 June 2024 and 14 February 2026, the caretaker regional government could no longer take new decisions in these areas.

### Commercial revitalisation: struggling neighbourhoods without support

#### The mechanism

Commercial revitalisation programmes aim to combat the decline of Brussels' commercial centres. They fund the renovation of empty retail units, support for struggling shopkeepers, improvement of public spaces around commercial areas and collective promotion of shopping neighbourhoods.

#### What is blocked

With a vacancy rate estimated at approximately **15%** in the Brussels Region, the need for revitalisation remained significant. Under the caretaker government:

- **No new calls for projects** for the renovation of empty retail units
- **No funding** for new shopkeeper support programmes
- **No partnership agreements** with municipalities for revitalisation projects
- **No support** for shopkeeper associations to develop collective strategies

Some Brussels neighbourhoods, particularly in low-income areas, saw their commercial situation deteriorate in the absence of regional support.

Source: hub.brussels, Brussels commerce observatory, 2025; Atrium Brussels, activity report 2024.

### Night economy: a strategy on hold

#### The stakes

Brussels has a rich nightlife that contributes to its attractiveness and generates significant economic activity: restaurants, bars, concert venues, clubs. The Region had begun developing a specific strategy to support and regulate this night economy, balancing economic activity, residents' peace and security.

#### The consequences

- **No adoption** of the night economy strategy
- **No adapted regulatory framework** for nighttime activities
- **No structural mediation** between nighttime operators and residents
- **No funding** for adapted nighttime safety and cleanliness programmes

Source: hub.brussels, study on the Brussels night economy, 2024; BECI, commerce position paper, 2025.

### Commercial regulation: modernisation on hold

The regulatory framework for Brussels retail was due to be modernised to adapt to sector developments: the rise of e-commerce, new forms of commerce (pop-up stores, dark kitchens), adaptation of trading hours. Under the caretaker government:

- The **planned regulatory updates** could not be adopted
- The **administrative simplifications** promised to shopkeepers were postponed
- The **legal framework** for new forms of commerce remained unclear
- **Coordination** with the federal level on e-commerce issues stagnated

Source: UCM Brussels, survey of Brussels shopkeepers, 2025.

### Regional commerce action plan

The regional action plan coordinates all commerce support policies: shopkeeper training, digital support, promotion of Brussels artisans, commercial attractiveness. Under the caretaker government:

- **Renewal** of the expired plan was impossible
- **New support measures** could not be launched
- **Coordination** between different institutional actors was limited to routine tasks
- **Budgets** could not be reallocated to address sector emergencies

Source: hub.brussels, commerce action plan 2019-2024 (expired); Atrium Brussels, annual report 2024.

### What continues to function

#### Commercial activity

Brussels shopkeepers continue their activities within the existing regulatory framework. The market functions normally, although the absence of an active support policy weakens the most vulnerable businesses.

#### Existing permits

Commercial permits and authorisations issued before June 2024 remain fully valid. Renewal procedures within the framework of day-to-day management continue.

#### Basic support

hub.brussels and Atrium Brussels continue to support shopkeepers and entrepreneurs with existing resources and programmes.

### Impact on the ground

The freeze on regional mechanisms had visible consequences in Brussels neighbourhoods:

- **Increasing vacancy**: without a revitalisation programme, struggling shopping streets deteriorate
- **Weakened neighbourhood commerce**: small independent shopkeepers lack support against online competition
- **Slowed digital transition**: shopkeepers wishing to digitalise lack guidance
- **Declining commercial attractiveness**: Brussels loses ground to better-supported peripheral commercial zones

### Outlook

Brussels commerce faces a structural transformation: the rise of e-commerce, evolving consumption habits, sustainability challenges. Without an active regional policy, this transformation is occurring at the expense of neighbourhood shops and the vitality of local areas.

The new regional government will need to relaunch commercial revitalisation programmes and adapt the regulatory framework to the sector's new realities, or risk increasing vacancy rates and deterioration of the local commercial fabric.

## Housing (sector)

### Housing, the primary concern of Brussels residents

Housing is the primary concern of residents of the Brussels-Capital Region. With rents among the highest in Belgium and a structurally insufficient social housing stock, the Brussels housing crisis is a long-standing challenge that the current political crisis is making worse.

The sector depends on several regional mechanisms: **social housing construction programmes** led by the SLRB/BGHM, **rent regulation**, the **investment plan** for renovating the existing social housing stock, and **urban renovation contracts** that incorporate affordable housing.

Between 9 June 2024 and 14 February 2026, the caretaker regional government could no longer take new structural decisions on housing.

### Social housing construction: supply stagnates

#### The mechanism

The SLRB/BGHM (Brussels Regional Housing Corporation) coordinates regional social housing policy. It oversees the 16 SISP (public housing companies) that manage approximately **40,000 social housing units**. New construction programmes are decided and funded at the regional level.

#### What is blocked

With over **50,000 households** on the social housing waiting list, the need for construction was massive. Under the caretaker government:

- **No new social housing construction programmes**
- **No new land** identified or acquired for construction
- **No public-private partnerships** for mixed housing projects
- **No revision** of allocation criteria to respond to emergency situations

Projects already committed before June 2024 continue, but the pipeline for new projects is empty.

Source: SLRB/BGHM, annual report 2024; waiting list statistics, 2025.

### Rent regulation: the status quo

#### The stakes

Brussels is the only Belgian Region where the question of rent regulation has been politically discussed. The indicative rent grid, a non-binding reference tool, was due to be strengthened. The Brussels rental framework also required adaptations to protect tenants from rising rents.

#### What is suspended

- **No strengthening** of the indicative rent grid
- **No introduction** of a binding rent regulation mechanism
- **No adaptation** of legislation on primary residence leases
- **No new measures** to protect against abusive evictions

The rental framework remains as it was before June 2024, with no adaptation to market developments.

Source: Rent Observatory, report 2024; Tenants' Union, analyses 2025.

### SLRB/BGHM investment plan: renovation slows

#### The context

Brussels' social housing stock is ageing. Many units require significant renovation work: thermal insulation, safety compliance, replacement of technical installations. The SLRB/BGHM's multi-year investment plan provided for an ambitious renovation programme.

#### The consequences

- The **investment plan** could not be renewed or extended
- **Renovation budgets** are limited to already approved allocations
- **Emergency repairs** are maintained, but major renovations are postponed
- The **energy performance** of the social housing stock stagnates while energy costs rise

Social housing tenants bore the direct consequences of this freeze: poorly insulated units, high energy bills, persistent damp problems.

Source: SLRB/BGHM, investment plan 2020-2024 (expired); SISP reports, 2024.

### Urban renovation contracts: forgotten neighbourhoods

Urban renovation contracts are an essential tool of Brussels' urban policy. They enable the revitalisation of disadvantaged neighbourhoods by combining affordable housing construction, public space renovation and creation of community facilities. Under the caretaker government:

- **No new urban renovation contracts**
- **No funding** for new housing projects in targeted neighbourhoods
- **No strengthened coordination** between regional and municipal levels
- **No structural response** to gentrification and social mix challenges

Source: Perspective.brussels, urban renovation contracts review, 2024.

### What continues to function

#### Management of the existing stock

The 16 SISP continue to manage the approximately 40,000 existing social housing units. Allocation of vacant units, routine maintenance and rent collection continue normally.

#### Lease contracts

Existing lease contracts, both in the social and private sectors, remain fully in force. The rights and obligations of tenants and landlords are not affected by the caretaker government.

#### Housing allowances

Housing allowances (rent subsidies) already granted continue to be paid within existing budgets.

### The disengagement of private investors

The **Federia Barometre des locations 2025** (published 11 February 2026) confirms a worrying trend: estate agents signed **10% fewer rental contracts in 2024**, despite sustained demand. Federia identifies a **"progressive disengagement of private investors"** from the Brussels rental market.

This decline is explained by a combination of factors:

- **Regulatory uncertainty**: rent control (May 2025) and the outdated reference grid (2017-2020 data) create legal ambiguity
- **Punitive taxation**: registration duties remain at 12.5% in Brussels, compared to 3% in Wallonia and 2% in Flanders
- **Political paralysis**: the absence of a government prevents any adaptation of the regulatory framework

The median apartment rent reached **1,213 euro/month** at end 2025, up 28% since 2021. Finding housing under 1,000 euro/month has become rare, including for studios.

Source: Federia, Barometre des locations 2025.

### Impact on the ground

The freeze on regional mechanisms had direct human consequences:

- **Record waiting list**: 62,234 households awaiting social housing, representing 10% of Brussels households
- **Persistent poor housing**: without renovation of the social stock, living conditions do not improve
- **Rental precariousness**: without regulatory adaptation, private-sector tenants remain exposed to rent increases
- **Shrinking supply**: the disengagement of private investors is reducing available supply
- **Struggling neighbourhoods**: without urban renovation contracts, the deterioration of certain neighbourhoods continues

### Outlook

Housing was the area where Brussels' political crisis had the most direct human consequences. Each month without new construction programmes meant additional years of waiting for households on the social housing waiting list.

The new regional government will need to make housing an absolute priority: relaunching social construction, renovating the existing stock, adapting rent regulation and responding to the urgency of poor housing conditions in Brussels.
