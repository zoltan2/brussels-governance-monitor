## First field action: Gare du Midi (17 February)

Three days after the swearing-in, the minister-president made his first field visit to the **Gare du Midi**, accompanied by the State Secretary for Urban Planning and the mayors of Anderlecht and Forest. His assessment: "there is room for improvement in coordination" between the actors present (local police zones, Federal Police, SNCB, Stib, communes).

This visit directly illustrates the challenge behind the **10 million EUR** earmarked by the RPD for securing the Midi and Nord stations. The multiplicity of security actors on site (6 police zones, Federal Railway Police, SNCB security, Stib guards) confirms the need for an integrated coordination plan.

## Government agreement: what changes

The agreement of 12 February 2026 dedicates an entire chapter to security:

- **Regional anti-drugs commissioner** — dedicated authority for the fight against narcotics
- **10 million EUR** investment for securing the **Midi and Nord railway stations**
- **Integrated regional drugs plan** — chain approach (prevention, harm reduction, enforcement)
- **Interconnected video surveillance** — integration of local systems with the Federal Police
- **Two phases of SIAMU reinforcement** (fire brigade)
- Dedicated recruitment pathway for security professions

## Inherited context

Bruxelles Prévention & Sécurité (BPS) is the regional body responsible for coordinating security and prevention policy in Brussels. It works in conjunction with the six Brussels police zones and the 19 communes.

The previous regional security plan had expired and was due for renewal by the new government following the 2024 elections.

## What was blocked (June 2024 — February 2026)

- The adoption of a new regional security plan
- The definition of new prevention priorities
- Funding for new prevention programmes
- Updated coordination between police zones and communes

Existing measures continued to operate, but without a renewed strategic framework.

## Issues to monitor

- **Anti-drugs commissioner**: the modalities of the function (powers, budget, reporting line) remain to be defined
- **Railway stations**: coordination with SNCB (federal) and local police zones will determine the effectiveness of the 10M EUR
- **Video surveillance**: the interconnection raises questions about privacy and proportionality
- **Merger of police zones**: mentioned in the DPR, it requires a vote at the federal level
- **Prevention**: security challenges are evolving (cybercrime, radicalisation, urban violence) and the new plan will need to address them
