## RPD commitments

The Regional Policy Declaration addresses education and training from the perspective of regional and community competences exercised in Brussels:

### Early childhood

- **Creating childcare places** — investment plan to increase capacity, coordinated with ONE (FWB) and Opgroeien (Flemish Community)
- **Financial accessibility** — maintaining and strengthening regional subsidies for childcare facilities

### School dropout

- **Anti-dropout action plan** — coordination between Region, Cocof, VGC and both Communities
- **Actiris Jeunes** — integration measures for young people leaving school without a diploma
- **Vocational education** — strengthening technical and professional streams, aligned with Brussels labour market needs

### Bilingualism and coordination

- **Promoting FR/NL bilingualism** — in schools and vocational training
- **Cocof/VGC coordination** — harmonising French-speaking and Dutch-speaking education policies in Brussels
- **School mobility** — transport and accessibility of schools across the 19 municipalities

## Education governance in Brussels

Education in Brussels falls primarily under the Communities (FWB and Flemish Community), but the Region intervenes through:

- **Cocof** — transferred competences in French-speaking education (continuing education, lifelong learning)
- **VGC** — Dutch-speaking competences in education, culture and welfare
- **Actiris / Bruxelles Formation / VDAB Brussel** — vocational training and youth integration

## Sources and methodology

The commitments documented above come from the official RPD text and corroborating press sources covering the government agreement of 12 February 2026. Indicators (childcare coverage, dropout) come from ONE, Opgroeien, IBSA and Eurostat.
