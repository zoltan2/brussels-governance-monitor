The term Round is a deliberate anglicism adopted by the Brussels Governance Monitor to describe each distinct sequence in the process of forming a Brussels regional government. A Round begins with the appointment of an informateur or formateur and ends either with the effective formation of the government or with the failure of the attempt.

This division into Rounds makes it possible to structure the chronological monitoring of the formation process, which can extend over many months. Each Round is the subject of specific monitoring in the BGM, with its own actors, issues and timetable. The transition from one Round to another generally marks a turning point in the negotiations.

The use of this English term is deliberate: it avoids any confusion with existing Belgian institutional vocabulary and underscores the iterative and sometimes cyclical nature of the formation process, where each attempt can be seen as a round in a broader negotiation.
