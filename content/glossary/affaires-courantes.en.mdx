Caretaker government (French: affaires courantes) is the legal regime that applies when a resigned government has not yet been replaced. This framework considerably restricts the executive's scope of action: only urgent decisions, routine administrative matters and files already in progress may be handled. Any new political initiative is in principle excluded.

In the Brussels context, this situation can arise after regional elections when the formation of a new government takes time, or following a political crisis. The duration of the caretaker period is not limited in time, which can generate prolonged institutional paralysis.

The consequences are particularly acute for the Brussels-Capital Region, where major dossiers such as Metro 3, housing policy and European funds require binding political decisions that the caretaker framework does not permit.
