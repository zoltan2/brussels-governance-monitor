## A massive electoral result

Woluwe-Saint-Pierre is a residential municipality of approximately 42,000 inhabitants. In the 2024 elections, the joint list Cerexhe (Les Engagés) - Bertrand (MR) achieved a massive result of **61.7%** (+30 points), winning 24 of 35 seats. Competencies are split 50-50 between Engagés and MR.

## Transparency: 4 out of 6 criteria

The **budget**, council **minutes** and agenda are published online, sessions are broadcast via **livestream** on YouTube, and the **mandate registry** is accessible via the transparency page. However, no **Open Data** portal and no **participatory budget** despite earlier commitments. Only advisory councils exist.

## Absence of structured citizen participation

Woluwe-Saint-Pierre is one of the few Brussels municipalities without a participatory budget or citizen participation platform, despite commitments made in 2019.

## Parking: transfer to Parking Brussels

From **1 March 2026**, Woluwe-Saint-Pierre hands over parking management to **Parking Brussels** (regional agency). The free parking period drops from 30 to **15 minutes** (exception: Place Dumon, 45 minutes). **Scancar** vehicles will gradually replace stewards for enforcement. Fines will be sent by post. The municipality expects a **30%** increase in parking revenue.
