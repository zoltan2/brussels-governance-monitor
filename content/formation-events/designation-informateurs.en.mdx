## What happened

On 16 February 2025, the day after the first formateur's resignation, the Brussels Parliament designated a duo of informateurs. The choice fell on a figure from Les Engages and a figure from Groen, ensuring bilingual representation from the outset.

## Why a bilingual duo

The choice of a bilingual duo was a direct response to the failure of the first round. The Arizona formula had stumbled on linguistic balances; it was therefore logical that the next information phase should integrate this dimension from the start. Les Engages, a pivotal French-speaking party, and Groen, a Dutch-speaking party open to dialogue, embodied this commitment to bridging the communities.

## The mandate

The informateurs received a broad and open mandate: to explore all possible coalition configurations, without limiting themselves to the Arizona formula. They were to consult all parties and submit a report with a clear recommendation to the President of Parliament.

This change of approach -- moving from formation to information -- reflected the realisation that the crisis first required a diagnostic exercise before new negotiations could be launched.
