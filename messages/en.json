    "concreteImpactTitle": "What this means in practice",
    "concreteImpact": {
      "budget": "No new budget can be voted. The Region operates on the basis of the previous budget, rolled over through provisional twelfths. New investments are legally impossible and the real value of existing expenditure is eroded by inflation.",
      "mobility": "Major infrastructure projects (Metro 3, tunnel renovations, new phases of Good Move) cannot receive political approval. STIB (Brussels transit) maintains existing services but no new development can be launched.",
      "employment": "The Region cannot create new employment programmes or adapt its measures to the federal unemployment reform. Existing measures continue but without the possibility of adjustment in response to rising unemployment.",
      "housing": "No new social housing programme can be launched. The Housing Fund has suspended its lending. The waiting list (62,234 households) grows each month with no possibility of a structural policy response.",
      "climate": "The new phases of the Air-Climate-Energy Plan cannot be launched. Renolution energy renovation grants are limited to existing budgets. The trajectory towards the target of -40% CO2 by 2030 is falling behind due to the absence of new decisions.",
      "social": "Bi-community investments by COCOM (Joint Community Commission) are frozen. CPAS (public social welfare centres) face a surge in requests without additional resources. New initiatives in mental health and homelessness policy are on hold.",
      "security": "The new government plans an anti-drugs commissioner, a €10 million investment in railway stations, connecting CCTV systems and reinforcing the fire service (SIAMU). These measures must be funded through the 2026 budget.",
      "economy": "The new government plans an Urban Free Zone at the Port and Forest, positioning Brussels as an AI capital, and opening Kanal museum. Implementation depends on implementing decrees and the budget.",
      "cleanliness": "The new government plans a reform of Brussels Cleanliness Agency, regional brigades, underground waste containers and immediate fines. Implementation depends on the budget and coordination with municipalities.",
      "institutional": "The new government plans to merge 25 structures into 4 pillars, cutting costs by 20-30%. Pillars 1 and 2 must be operational in 2026, but some mergers require special majorities in Parliament."
    },
    "whyStatusTitle": "Why this status",
    "whyStatus": {
      "budget": "Voting a new regional budget requires a fully empowered government (Special Law of 12 January 1989). Under caretaker government, Parliament can only vote provisional twelfths. No alternative authority exists for this competence. The active fallback mechanism is the rollover of the previous budget through provisional twelfths (ordinance of 20/12/2024).",
      "mobility": "The Metro 3 and Good Move Phase 2 projects require government decisions (approval of public procurement, multi-year budget commitments). These decisions fall outside the scope of caretaker government. Parliament has questioned the outgoing government on this matter. STIB (Brussels transit) continues its day-to-day operations but the contractual deadlines for Metro 3 have been exceeded.",
      "employment": "Regional employment activation measures (training plans, subsidised jobs) have regulatory deadlines that are expiring. Renewing these measures requires government decisions. Actiris continues its day-to-day operations but cannot adapt its programmes to the federal unemployment reform.",
      "housing": "The creation of social housing and the allocation of credits to the Housing Fund require new budget commitments, which are impossible under caretaker government. The SLRB (Brussels social housing agency) continues managing the existing stock but cannot launch any new construction. The waiting list exceeds 62,000 households, a record threshold.",
      "climate": "The adoption of the new phases of the Air-Climate-Energy Plan (PACE) requires government approval. The deadlines set by the 2030 target have been formally exceeded without a structural decision. Brussels Environment continues its existing programmes but without a new budget for expanded Renolution grants.",
      "social": "Investment decisions by COCOM (Joint Community Commission, a bi-community competence) require political approval that is impossible under caretaker government. CPAS (public social welfare centres) depend on regional subsidies whose budgets cannot be increased. Iriscare operates in minimal mode. The number of counted homeless persons is rising without the possibility of a policy response.",
      "security": "The Security chapter of the RPD provides for an integrated regional plan: an anti-drugs commissioner, €10M for securing South and North stations, interconnection of CCTV systems and reinforcement of SIAMU (fire service). These measures require implementing decrees and budget allocations in the 2026 budget.",
      "economy": "The Economy chapter of the RPD provides for the creation of an Urban Free Zone (Brussels Port + Audi Forest site), positioning Brussels as an AI capital, and opening the Kanal museum under new governance. Implementation depends on implementing decrees and the 2026 budget.",
      "cleanliness": "The Cleanliness chapter of the RPD provides for a reform of the Brussels Cleanliness Agency (ABP), regional cleanliness brigades, underground waste containers and immediate fine collection. Implementation depends on budget allocations in the 2026 budget.",
      "institutional": "Chapter 4 of the RPD provides for the merger of 25 regional structures into 4 pillars, with savings of 20-30% on operating costs. Pillars 1 and 2 must be operational by 2026. Some mergers require special majorities in Parliament."

    "notSaid": {
      "budget": "This card does not say that the current budget is inherently insufficient — it documents that the absence of a new budget prevents any adaptation to current economic realities. The correlation between caretaker government and budgetary deterioration is not presented as direct causation.",
      "mobility": "This card does not say that the mobility projects have been cancelled — it documents that they are awaiting a political decision. The observed delay may have multiple causes, some of which predate the government crisis.",
      "employment": "This card does not say that rising unemployment is caused by the absence of government — it documents that regional response measures are frozen while the unemployment rate evolves. Employment dynamics depend on multiple factors (economic conditions, federal reform, economic structure).",
      "housing": "This card does not say that the housing crisis was born with the government crisis — the social housing deficit is structural and predates it. It documents that the absence of government prevents any new policy response to a deteriorating situation.",
      "climate": "This card does not say that Brussels will miss its climate targets because of the absence of government — it documents that the decision-making mechanisms needed to reach those targets are frozen. Reaching the 2030 target depends on many factors beyond regional governance.",
      "social": "This card does not say that social services have stopped functioning — CPAS (public social welfare centres) and Iriscare continue their core mission. It documents that new investments, capacity adjustments, and structural reforms are impossible under caretaker government.",
      "security": "This page does not claim that the regional security plan will solve all safety challenges — it documents the quantified commitments from the RPD. Effectiveness depends on actual funding, coordination with police zones and federal cooperation.",
      "economy": "This page does not claim that economic measures will guarantee growth — it documents the RPD commitments on attractiveness and development. Actual impact will depend on the international economic climate and effective implementation of announced measures.",
      "cleanliness": "This page does not claim that cleanliness measures will solve the problem immediately — it documents the concrete commitments from the RPD. Effectiveness depends on deployment of resources, Region-municipality coordination and user behaviour.",
      "institutional": "This page does not claim that institutional simplification will be straightforward — it documents the rationalisation commitments from the RPD. These reforms require complex political agreements and special majorities in Parliament."

    "backToHome": "Back to home",
    "questions": {
      "q1": "Why doesn't Brussels have a government?",
      "a1": "Since the regional elections of 9 June 2024, Brussels political parties have failed to form a majority coalition in parliament. Brussels' institutional structure, which requires majorities in both linguistic groups, complicates formation. Several attempts have failed due to disagreements over coalition formulas and the distribution of competences.",
      "q2": "What does 'caretaker government' mean?",
      "a2": "A caretaker government can only manage day-to-day matters and continue existing commitments. It cannot launch new policies, vote a new budget, or make strategic decisions. The budget is managed through provisional twelfths: each month, one twelfth of the previous budget is rolled over.",
      "q3": "What are the concrete impacts for residents?",
      "a3": "Infrastructure projects are frozen (Metro 3, tunnel renovations), housing policies are suspended (Housing Fund, rental guarantee), the job market suffers from inaction (ONEM exclusions), and the regional budget loses real value due to inflation without possible adjustment.",
      "q4": "Has this happened before in Belgium?",
      "a4": "At the federal level, yes. Belgium held the world record for the longest period without a government: 541 days between 2010 and 2011. At the Brussels regional level, the current situation is unprecedented in both duration and complexity.",
      "q5": "Who can unblock the situation?",
      "a5": "The Brussels political parties elected to the regional parliament. It is the President of the Brussels Parliament who steers the formation process and designates informateurs, formateurs, or facilitators (unlike at the federal level, the King plays no role in the formation of the regional government). As a last resort, new regional elections are theoretically possible but constitutionally near-impossible.",
      "q6": "What are provisional twelfths?",
      "a6": "An emergency budget mechanism that rolls over one twelfth of the last approved budget each month. This allows salaries and current expenses to be paid but prevents any new investment and any adjustment to inflation or changing needs.",
      "q7": "What are BGM's sources?",
      "a7": "All our data comes from official sources (Court of Auditors, Brussels parliament, regional administrations) or reliable secondary sources (press, academic studies). Every figure is accompanied by its source and confidence level. Everything is available on the Data page.",
      "q8": "Is BGM affiliated with a political party?",
      "a8": "No. Brussels Governance Monitor is an independent project hosted by Advice That SRL. It is not funded or supported by any political party, trade union, or interest group. The source code is publicly available to ensure full transparency. All rights reserved.",
      "q9": "How can I contribute?",
      "a9": "You can report an error, propose a correction, or submit new sources via our GitHub repository. The source code is open and contributions are welcome. You can also subscribe to email alerts to follow the evolution of the situation.",
      "q10": "How long can this last?",
      "a10": "There is no legal limit to the duration of caretaker government in Belgium. The situation could theoretically last until the next regional elections scheduled for 2029. In practice, citizen pressure, media attention, and European budget deadlines could accelerate negotiations.",
      "q11": "Why is Brussels so complex?",
      "a11": "Brussels is simultaneously a Region, the capital of Belgium, the seat of the EU, and a city of 19 autonomous municipalities. Six different governments exercise competences there (federal, regional, COCOM, COCOF, VGC, municipal). Forming a regional government requires a double linguistic majority (FR + NL), which complicates coalition-building. This institutional architecture, unique in the world, is the result of historical compromises between linguistic communities."
