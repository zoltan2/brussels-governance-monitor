## Official agenda

The Brussels Parliament has published the agenda for the plenary session of Monday 23 February 2026:

- **Item 1** — Regional Policy Declaration of the Government
- **Item 2** — General debate

The confidence vote remains scheduled for Wednesday 25 February.

## Ongoing language debate

Five days after the signing of the government agreement, the Dutch-language version of the RPD was still not finalised (BRUZZ, 17 February 2026). The delay, attributed to linguistic errors in the translation, has fuelled the debate on institutional bilingualism.

The language question remains a structural issue in Belgium: the 1831 Constitution only received an official Dutch text in 1967 — for 136 years, only the French text had legal standing. The German version was not adopted until 1991.
