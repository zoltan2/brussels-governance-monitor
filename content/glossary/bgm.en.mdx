The Brussels Governance Monitor (BGM) is an independent civic project whose mission is to monitor, document and analyse the government formation process of the Brussels-Capital Region. Born from the observation that Brussels citizens lacked a clear and accessible tool to understand the stakes of government formation, the BGM provides structured and factual monitoring of each step of the process.

The project is built around several pillars: a timeline of formation-related events, a glossary of institutional terms, an analysis of the crisis's impact on regional policies and a monitoring of dossiers blocked by the absence of a government. The BGM uses the concept of a Round to structure the various formation attempts and applies distinct confidence levels to its information (official source vs BGM estimate).

The BGM is committed to political neutrality and factual rigour. No content aims to promote any particular party or coalition. The goal is to strengthen democratic transparency and enable Brussels citizens to understand the stakes and consequences of a process that directly affects their daily lives.
