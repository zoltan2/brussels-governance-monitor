## The second most densely populated municipality in Brussels

Schaerbeek is the second most populated municipality in the Brussels-Capital Region with nearly 130,000 inhabitants on only 8.14 km², making it one of the densest municipalities in Belgium (~16,000 inhabitants/km²).

## Transparency: 4 full criteria, 1 partial

Schaerbeek achieves a good transparency score. The **municipal budget** is fully published online (PDF and Excel annexes), council **minutes** are accessible, the council is broadcast via **livestream** on YouTube with archives, and the **mandate registry** is published with individual declarations since 2011.

However, Schaerbeek does not have its own municipal **Open Data** portal (only regional data is available via opendata.brussels). **Citizen participation** is classified as "partial": the municipality does not have a dedicated platform such as Decidim, but offers citizen interpellation mechanisms (25 signatures) and a localised participatory budget (Pogge neighbourhood, ~40,000 EUR/year).

## Late formation of the majority

The municipal elections of October 2024 were followed by 7 months of negotiations in Schaerbeek, a record for the municipality. The new MR-Engages + PS + Ecolo-Groen + LB (DeFi) majority was installed in May 2025 with a mayoral rotation agreement: Audrey Henry (MR) until February 2028, then Hasan Koyuncu (PS) until 2030.

## Citizen participation: localised mechanisms

Without a dedicated digital platform at the municipal level, Schaerbeek nonetheless offers several participatory mechanisms: citizen interpellation at the municipal council (minimum 25 signatures), a participatory budget in the Pogge neighbourhood (as part of the Sustainable Neighbourhood Contract), a youth council, and neighbourhood committees.
