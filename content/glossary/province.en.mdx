Belgium has ten provinces, divided between the Flemish Region (five) and the Walloon Region (five). The Brussels-Capital Region is the exception: it has no province. This unique situation results from the special law of 12 January 1989 on Brussels institutions, which provided that provincial competences would be exercised directly by regional institutions.

In practical terms, matters that fall under provincial jurisdiction elsewhere (such as certain aspects of education, road management, support for municipalities or the management of certain public facilities) are managed in Brussels by the Region itself or by the 19 municipalities. There is no provincial council nor a provincial governor for Brussels, although a governor of the administrative district of Brussels-Capital exists with limited competences.

This absence of a provincial level theoretically simplifies Brussels governance, but it also means that the Region must directly assume proximity tasks that provinces carry out elsewhere. During a crisis, this additional burden weighs on a regional administration already limited by the caretaker regime.
