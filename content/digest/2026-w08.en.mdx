## Government Installation and Regional Policy Declaration Publication

This week was marked by the inauguration of the Brussels government and the publication of the Regional Policy Declaration (RPD). Minister-President Ahmed Laaouej (PS) was validated on 20 February to head the Brussels-Cocof executive, with a MR-PS-Committed majority. The RPD will be presented to the Brussels Parliament on 23 February at 4:30 PM, followed by a confidence vote on 25 February. This publication marks the transition of six domains from « crisis » status to definitive status : the lifting of institutional blockages enables a factual redescription of the situation.

## Social Emergencies : Homeless Minors and ONEM Exclusions

A joint alert from KRC and DGDE reveals that **1,678 minors** are among the **9,777 homeless** identified in Brussels, an increase of **+72 %** since 2020. Samusocial reports approximately **127 shelter refusals per week** for families. Winter shelter, accommodating **285 places**, must close on 31 March, further exacerbating precarity.

Meanwhile, the fifth wave of ONEM exclusions strikes Brussels hard : approximately **37,000 people** (representing **22.1 %** of the national total of **168,063** exclusions) will lose their benefits between July 2026 and July 2027. The Court of Audit confirms that CPAS compensation will be underestimated at **709.3 million EUR** through 2029, insufficient to absorb this influx.

## Action Areas : New Additions and Updates

Three new domains have been integrated into BGM monitoring : **Urban Planning**, **Digital** and **Education**. The Urban Planning domain covers accelerated permits, urban amnesty, and abolition of the binding CRMS advisory opinion. The Digital domain addresses the digital divide, administrative simplification, and Brussels' position as an AI capital. The Education domain covers childcare places, school dropout rates, and Cocof/VGC coordination.

Two new thematic dossiers enrich monitoring : **Accessibility and Disability** (**23,100** benefit recipients, **55/69** metro stations accessible) and **Seniors in Brussels** (**163,000** people aged 65+, **11,592** nursing home residents).

## Sectoral Crises and Corrective Measures

**Vivaqua** : the rate increase of **+12.5 %** on 1 January 2026 comes with alarming data. BRUGEL denounces mismanagement : **73 million EUR** in unpaid accounts, **35 million EUR** in rejected costs, and debt estimated at approximately **1 billion EUR**. A recapitalization of **180 million EUR** is planned, with Hydria integration and urgent renovation of **220 km** of pipes.

**Housing** : the Renolution relief finally advances with **56 million EUR** (50 million Urban.Brussels + 6 million Leefmilieu Brussel). Among **2,692** validated dossiers, over **600** are in progress, with payments expected by end of 2026. A zero-interest loan program will begin in 2027, endowed with **66 million EUR** annually.

**Cleanliness** : **7,731** fines were issued in 2025 for illegal dumping (+61 %), with **36.7 %** against non-residents (« waste tourism »). Total amount is approximately **12 million EUR**. The Region plans underground containers and smart cameras to curb this phenomenon.

## Systems and Data : Structural Enhancements

A new tagging system has been deployed on the site : **13 labels** identify priority populations (Seniors, PwD, Youth, Families, Newcomers, Homeless, Self-employed, Tenants) and cross-cutting issues (Gender, Cost of Living, Precarity, Bilingualism, Civic Participation). The source registry, now filterable by domain, counts **262 sources** assigned to one or more domains.
