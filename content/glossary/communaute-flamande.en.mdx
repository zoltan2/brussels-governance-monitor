The Flemish Community (Vlaamse Gemeenschap) is one of the three Communities in the Belgian federal system. Its distinctive feature is having merged its institutions with those of the Flemish Region as early as 1980, creating a single Flemish Parliament and a single Flemish government that exercise both community and regional competences. This merger is unique in Belgian federalism.

The community competences of the Flemish Community cover education, culture, sport, social welfare, health policy and language use. In Brussels, these competences are exercised for Dutch-speakers primarily through the VGC (Flemish Community Commission), which serves as a local relay. The Flemish government also invests directly in Dutch-speaking Brussels institutions (schools, childcare centres, cultural centres).

The Flemish Community is not directly affected by the Brussels regional formation crisis, as it has its own full government. However, Flemish policies in Brussels require coordination with regional authorities, and the absence of a functional regional interlocutor complicates certain projects, particularly in education and welfare.
