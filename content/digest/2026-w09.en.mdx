## Urban Mobility : Tensions Over Good Move and Redesigns

The municipality of Jette has served notice on the Region to reopen Broustin Avenue, closed since 2021-2022 under the Good Move plan. **70 %** of residents oppose the prolonged closure beyond the test phase. A threat of legal action looms over this situation.

Meanwhile, a building permit has been filed for the redesign of the Trois Fontaines viaduct (Auderghem), involving the removal of **60 parking spaces** and drainage works. Auderghem opposes the project and demands its integration into the Hermann-Debroux development plan, which should include a park-and-ride facility (**40 million EUR**) and a never-funded tram.

## Local Taxation : 9 Municipalities Raise Property Tax

Nine of the 19 municipalities announced a property tax increase in 2026 : Auderghem, Brussels-City, Etterbeek, Evere, Ganshoren, Koekelberg, Saint-Josse, Uccle and Watermael-Boitsfort. The increase can reach up to **~210 EUR per year** in Saint-Josse.

## Cleanliness : +61 % Fines for Illegal Dumping

**7,731 fines** were issued in 2025 for illegal dumping (**+61 %**), totaling **~12 million EUR**. **36.7 %** of these fines concern non-residents ("waste tourism"). The price differential for waste bags in Brussels (10x cheaper) fuels this phenomenon. The Region plans deployment of underground containers and smart cameras.

## Horeca : VAT Increase and Sectoral Impacts

VAT on accommodation increases from **6 %** to **12 %** on March 1st, 2026. This federal increase represents a cost increase of **+8.50 EUR** on a **150 EUR** overnight stay. A transitional measure is provided until June 30th, but implementation is complicated by a dual breakfast tariff depending on inclusion. The Brussels horeca sector recorded **2,184 bankruptcies** in 2025, with **5,631 jobs** lost nationally.
