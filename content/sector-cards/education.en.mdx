## Government agreement: announced impacts

> **Note**: The official DPR text has not yet been published. The measures below are drawn from corroborating press sources (RTBF, La Libre, DH, BX1, VRT NWS, BRUZZ). They will be updated once the official document is released.

According to corroborating press sources, the agreement of 12 February 2026 includes several measures that impact the education and training sector:

- **70% employment target**: vocational training is a central lever for achieving this goal. Bruxelles Formation and accredited training providers will be called upon to strengthen qualifying pathways
- **Actiris support deadline reduced** from 5 to 3 months: this acceleration requires closer coordination between Actiris, Bruxelles Formation and VDAB Brussels
- **Bilingualism: raised ambitions** -- the agreement announces a strengthening of bilingualism, which could revive the bilingual education pilot projects suspended since June 2024
- **Administrative reform (merger of pillars)**: Bruxelles Formation could be affected by the reorganisation of the 25 regional structures into 3 to 4 entities

**Point of attention**: the end of the caretaker period allows training programmes, school renovations and frozen education subsidies to be unblocked. However, the budgetary effort means that not all pending initiatives will be funded simultaneously.

The following sections document the inherited situation and contextual data.

## Education and training: a major regional issue

Education and vocational training are a central issue for the Brussels-Capital Region. With a **youth unemployment rate of approximately 28%**, a dense school network of **700 schools** and a regional vocational training body (**Bruxelles Formation**) that serves **18,000 trainees per year**, education and training policies are essential levers for socio-economic integration.

In Belgium, compulsory education falls under the competence of the Communities (French, Flemish, German-speaking). However, the Brussels-Capital Region exercises its own competences in **vocational training**, **school infrastructure**, **educational coordination** and **bilingual projects**. These competences are directly affected by the caretaker freeze.

## Bruxelles Formation: programmes on hold

### The role

**Bruxelles Formation** is the regional public body for vocational training. It offers qualifying training in dozens of occupations -- construction, digital, languages, management, healthcare -- aimed at Brussels jobseekers. The body works in partnership with Actiris, VDAB Brussels and numerous accredited training providers.

### What is blocked

Existing training programmes are being continued, but no new programme can be launched:

- **No new training courses** in sectors with labour shortages (digital, green transition, healthcare)
- **No adaptation** of existing programmes to labour market changes
- **No new partnerships** with private training providers
- **No strengthening** of skills validation mechanisms
- **No increase** in the number of places on the most in-demand courses

For a region where youth unemployment exceeds 28%, the freeze on training policy constitutes a structural handicap.

## School infrastructure: blocked renovations

### The situation

The Brussels school estate is ageing. Many buildings date from the early 20th century and require significant renovation: thermal insulation, safety standard compliance, PRM accessibility, digital equipment. **Perspective.brussels** estimates that over **100 school buildings** require priority intervention.

### What is suspended

School renovation projects that had not been formally committed (public procurement launched, budgets allocated) before June 2024 are blocked:

- **No new renovation projects** financed by the Region
- **No investment** in the energy efficiency of Brussels schools
- **No fire safety upgrades** for the oldest buildings
- **No creation** of new school places in demographically growing neighbourhoods

The municipalities, which manage part of the school estate, are also constrained in their investments by the regional budget situation.

## Bilingual education: suspended pilot projects

### The context

Brussels is an officially bilingual region (French-Dutch), but in practice bilingualism is declining. Knowledge of Dutch is nevertheless a considerable asset on the Brussels job market, and bilingual education is a lever for social cohesion in a linguistically diverse city.

Before June 2024, the Region had launched consultations and pilot projects aimed at strengthening bilingual education, in collaboration with the Communities. These initiatives are suspended.

### What is blocked

- **No launch** of new bilingual education pilot projects
- **No regional funding** for language bridging initiatives in schools
- **No enhanced coordination** between the French Community and the Flemish Community on the bilingual school offering
- **No support** for schools wishing to develop immersion programmes

## Subsidies for innovative education projects

Regional subsidy budgets for innovative education projects -- digital learning in schools, tackling school dropout, youth employment insertion -- are frozen:

- **No new regional calls for proposals** in the education field
- **No funding** for pedagogical experiments
- **No additional support** for schools in priority neighbourhoods
- **No investment** in digital educational tools

## What continues to function

### Existing training

Training programmes launched before June 2024 continue to be delivered. Enrolled trainees continue their training pathways. Bruxelles Formation and its partners ensure service continuity.

### Community education

The French and Flemish Communities continue to fully exercise their competences in compulsory education. Schools operate, teachers are in place, and curricula are delivered.

### Committed projects

School renovation projects whose public procurement had been launched before June 2024 continue normally.

## The populations most affected

The freeze on education and training mechanisms primarily affects:

- **Young jobseekers** who cannot find training suited to their career plans
- **Workers in career transition** who cannot access new qualifying programmes
- **Pupils in dilapidated schools** studying in deteriorating material conditions
- **Families in growing neighbourhoods** who lack school places
- **Non-bilingual Brussels youth** whose job market prospects are reduced

## Outlook

Education and training constitute the most cost-effective long-term investment for a region facing high structural unemployment. Each month without an active training policy represents skills not acquired, jobs not filled and young people remaining distant from the labour market.

The freeze on school renovations also has long-term consequences: buildings deteriorate, renovation costs increase and learning conditions worsen for pupils.
