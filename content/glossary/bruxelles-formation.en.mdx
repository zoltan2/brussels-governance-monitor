Bruxelles Formation is the regional public body responsible for vocational training of Brussels jobseekers. It offers qualifying training programmes in various sectors (digital, construction, languages, health, management) and welcomes approximately 18,000 trainees per year.

Vocational training is a central lever of regional employment policy, particularly in a context where the Brussels unemployment rate remains structurally higher than the Belgian average. The February 2026 government agreement sets an employment rate target of 70% and provides for strengthened coordination between Actiris, Bruxelles Formation and VDAB Brussel.
