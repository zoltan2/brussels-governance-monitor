## What happened

On 20 May 2025, the informateurs submitted their final report to the President of the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region. This summary document, the product of three months of consultations, contained a clear recommendation for the next phase of the formation process.

## The content of the report

The report established several findings:

1. **Arithmetical finding**: only a very limited number of coalition configurations command a majority in both linguistic groups of Parliament
2. **Programmatic finding**: the parties of the expanded progressive coalition share a sufficient common platform on the major regional priorities
3. **Feasibility finding**: despite divergences on certain points (budget, portfolio allocation), an agreement is deemed possible provided compromises are made

## The recommendation

The informateurs recommended that Parliament designate a new formateur with a specific mandate: to negotiate a government agreement between the PS, Ecolo, Groen, Les Engages, Vooruit and one.brussels. This six-party formula was the only one identified as commanding both an overall majority and support in each linguistic group.

## The significance

This report marked a pivotal moment in the formation. For the first time since the June 2024 elections, a concrete path towards a government was charted. The question was no longer "which coalition?" but "will the formateur manage to finalise the agreement?".
