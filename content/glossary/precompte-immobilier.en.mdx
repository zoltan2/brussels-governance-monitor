The property tax (précompte immobilier, or onroerende voorheffing in Dutch) is an annual tax owed by property owners in Belgium. It is calculated on the cadastral income of the property and consists of a regional share, a municipal share and an agglomeration share.

In Brussels, the property tax rate is a major political issue because it is structurally higher than in Flanders, which contributes to the fiscal exodus of households. The February 2026 agreement addresses this lever through the doubling of the BE HOME premium and tax relief in the urban free zones.
