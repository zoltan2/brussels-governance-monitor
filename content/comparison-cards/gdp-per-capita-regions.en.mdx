methodology: "Comparison of regional GDP per capita expressed in purchasing power standards (PPS), at NUTS-2 level, based on regional accounts published by Eurostat. PPS neutralise price level differences between countries, enabling a comparison of real purchasing power. GDP is measured at the place of production, not the place of residence of workers — a decisive point for interpreting the Brussels data."

caveat: "Brussels' GDP per capita is artificially inflated by the commuter effect: approximately 360,000 non-resident workers contribute to regional GDP without being counted in the reference population. This phenomenon, sometimes called the 'Brussels paradox', means that high GDP does not translate into high incomes for residents. The median disposable household income in Brussels is in fact below the Belgian average. This statistical bias affects all capital regions but is particularly pronounced in Brussels due to the compactness of the NUTS-2 territory."

## Context

GDP per capita in purchasing power standards (PPS) is the flagship indicator used by European institutions to compare regional prosperity. It neutralises price differences between countries and measures real economic output per head. However, for capital-city regions, this indicator suffers from a structural bias linked to commuter flows.

## The data compared

With a GDP of 62,200 PPS per capita in 2024, Brussels-Capital displays the highest figure among the five compared regions, ahead of Ile-de-France (57,800), Noord-Holland (55,300), Wien (52,400) and Berlin (42,100).

This ranking places Brussels among the EU's "wealthiest" regions according to Eurostat methodology — a result that starkly contrasts with the socio-economic reality experienced by a large share of its residents.

## The Brussels paradox

The Brussels-Capital Region's GDP per capita is structurally overvalued due to a major statistical effect:

- **The commuter effect**: every working day, approximately 360,000 people enter the Region to work. Their output is counted in Brussels' GDP, but they do not appear in the denominator (the resident population). The GDP-per-capita ratio is therefore mechanically inflated.
- **The contrast with incomes**: median disposable household income in Brussels falls below the Belgian average. In 2024, approximately 33% of the Brussels population lives below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold — the highest rate among the three Belgian Regions.
- **Geographic compactness**: at just 161 km², the Brussels Region excludes nearly all of its functional metropolitan area from its statistical perimeter, unlike regions such as Ile-de-France which include an extensive suburban ring.

## Comparison with other capitals

All EU capital regions experience some form of commuter effect, but its magnitude varies considerably:

- **Wien**: the Austrian capital incorporates a larger share of its employment basin within its NUTS-2 boundary, which mitigates the bias.
- **Berlin**: the German capital presents an inverse case — its GDP per capita is relatively modest owing to its history of division and a still-developing economic structure.
- **Ile-de-France**: the broad perimeter (12,012 km²) includes a significant share of commuters within the resident population, reducing distortion.
- **Noord-Holland**: the region encompasses Amsterdam but also less urbanised areas, which moderates the bias.

## What the comparison reveals

Brussels' GDP per capita illustrates a textbook case of the mismatch between wealth produced in a territory and wealth available to its residents. This situation is compounded by the ongoing governance crisis, which prevents the implementation of adapted redistribution and investment policies.
