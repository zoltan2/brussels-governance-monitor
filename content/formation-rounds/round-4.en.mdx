## Context

Faced with the impasse in the formation process, the president of the Brussels Parliament designates a facilitator charged with resolving the deadlock between the linguistic groups. Unlike at federal level, the King plays no role in the formation of Brussels regional governments -- it is Parliament that steers the process. The recourse to a facilitator, distinct from a formateur or an informateur, signals the exceptional gravity of the crisis.

## The mission

The facilitator receives a specific mandate: to resolve the Gordian knot of the linguistic balances that has blocked all formation efforts for more than a year. His mission is not to negotiate a complete government programme, but to find a framework agreement on the principles of cooperation between the two linguistic groups.

## Proceedings

The facilitator adopts a different approach from previous formateurs. Rather than negotiating with parties, he organises separate consultations with the two linguistic groups of Parliament, then joint sessions. He proposes a renewed institutional framework for the functioning of the Brussels government.

The consultations reveal a deep divide:
- The French-speaking group insists on demographic proportionality in decision-making
- The Dutch-speaking group demands reinforced guarantees of representation and veto powers

## Failure

On 31 October 2025, the facilitator submits his report to the president of Parliament. He notes the impossibility of reaching a framework agreement within the allotted time. The deadlock is not about the political programme -- the parties are relatively close on content -- but about the institutional architecture of decision-making.

This phase illustrates the structural dimension of the Brussels crisis: beyond programmatic disagreements, it is the very model of bilingual governance that is being tested.
