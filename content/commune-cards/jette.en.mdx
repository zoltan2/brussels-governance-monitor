## A transparency score to improve

Jette has 54,000 inhabitants and is led by Claire Vandevivere (Les Engagés) with a renewed Engagés-MR-Ecolo coalition. The municipality has the lowest transparency score among the 19 communes.

## Transparency: 2 out of 6 criteria

The **budget** is published online and the **mandate registry** is accessible via the transparency page (attendance, remunerations). However, council **minutes** are only partially available, the **livestream** is being set up following a citizen petition (300+ signatures), and there is no **Open Data** portal or confirmed **participation platform**.

## The livestream project

A citizen petition with over 300 signatures pushed the municipality to announce the upcoming implementation of council session livestreaming. Deployment is underway.
