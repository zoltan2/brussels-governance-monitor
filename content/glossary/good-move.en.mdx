Good Move is the regional mobility plan of the Brussels-Capital Region, adopted by the regional government in 2020. This strategic plan aims to profoundly transform Brussels mobility by 2030, by promoting sustainable modes of transport (public transport, cycling, walking) and reducing dependence on the private car.

The plan is implemented through mobility zones (low-traffic neighbourhoods) and provides for a reorganisation of traffic across the entire Region. It has sparked intense debate between supporters of calmer mobility and advocates for car accessibility, making mobility one of the most visible political issues in Brussels.

In the absence of a full government, the implementation of Good Move finds itself in a zone of uncertainty. Already approved zones continue to be rolled out by municipalities, but strategic adjustments, major investments in cycling infrastructure and the necessary political arbitrations are suspended. The future of the plan depends largely on the government agreement that will be negotiated.
