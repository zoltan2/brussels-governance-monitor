## Context

After the failure of the third formateur (Verougstraete, Round 5) and the unprecedented citizen pressure of Round 6, the MR president takes the initiative on 8 February 2026 to bring together 7 parties for a "finish conclave". The decisive turning point comes on 9 February when Anders (ex-Open VLD) agrees to negotiate **without the N-VA**, removing the lock that had blocked the formation for over 600 days.

## The configuration

For the first time in this crisis, a coalition commands a **double linguistic majority**:

- **French-speaking side**: MR, PS, Les Engagés
- **Dutch-speaking side**: Groen, Vooruit, Anders, CD&V

### The Anders pivot

The decisive moment is the reversal by Frederic De Gucht (Anders), who had refused three times to negotiate without the N-VA. Preliminary budget work by minister Dirk De Smedt with the PS created common ground between Laaouej and De Gucht. De Gucht stated: "There is a difference between being right and getting what you want."

### The conclave format

The chosen format — continuous negotiation at the University Foundation, Rue d'Egmont, without leaving the premises — aims to force an agreement before the carnival break. Negotiators were instructed to book hotel rooms. The agenda: budgetary framework targeting balance by 2029 + general policy statement.

## The stakes

- **Budget**: approximately EUR 1 billion deficit, balance required by 2029
- **Security**: 101 shootings in one year, 8 deaths — drug-related crime on the rise
- **Dutch-speaking arithmetic**: 4 Flemish parties for 3 ministerial posts — an additional secretary of state position may be created
- **Pressure factor**: Standard & Poor's visit imminent, Vivaqua and SLRB in financial asphyxiation

## Current situation

The conclave has been **underway** since 10 February 2026 at 10:30 AM. No results have been announced yet. Valentine Delwart (MR) is being positioned as a potential Minister-President.
