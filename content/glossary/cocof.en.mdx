The French Community Commission (COCOF) is one of the three community commissions of Brussels. It manages French-speaking matters in the Brussels-Capital Region, including culture, vocational training, social assistance and health policy. Since the 1993 reform, it has decree-making power, granting it genuine legislative autonomy in its areas of competence.

The COCOF has its own budget and administration. Its assembly is composed of the 72 French-speaking members of the Brussels Parliament. Its executive college is formed by the French-speaking members of the regional government, supplemented by members of the COCOM college. It constitutes an essential component of the Brussels institutional landscape.

During a regional formation crisis, the COCOF continues to function as it has its own decision-making bodies. However, the intertwining of regional and community mandates means that the same political leaders are affected by the crisis, which can slow down certain new initiatives.
