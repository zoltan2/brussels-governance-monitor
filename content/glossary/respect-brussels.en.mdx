**respect.brussels** is a civic collective born from the exasperation of Brussels residents at the record duration of the regional government formation crisis. The collective brings together citizens from all backgrounds, without partisan affiliation.

The landmark initiative of respect.brussels was to succeed, in late January 2026, in bringing together representatives of all **11 parties** present in the Brussels Parliament in a civic dialogue framework. This meeting was unprecedented in several respects:

- It was the first time all Brussels parties found themselves at the same table during the crisis
- The initiative came from civil society, not from the institutions
- The framework was non-partisan and transparent

The collective does not propose a political programme. It asks the parties to commit to a formation timetable and to minimum governance principles, considering that Brussels residents have the right to a functioning government regardless of its political colour.
