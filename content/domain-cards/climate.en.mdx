## Ambitious targets, uncertain trajectory

The Brussels-Capital Region has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by **47% by 2030** compared to 2005, within the framework of the Air-Climate-Energy Plan (PACE), under the EU "Fit for 55" package adopted definitively in May 2023. This target, aligned with European commitments, requires massive investment in building renovation, sustainable mobility and the energy transition.

Since June 2024, the regional government has been in caretaker mode. No new structural political decisions can be taken. The PACE continues on its existing trajectory for programmes already approved, but new phases are frozen.

## Renolution grants under pressure

### The scheme

Renolution is the one-stop shop for renovation and energy grants in the Brussels Region. It brings together the former energy, renovation and facade improvement grants. The scheme aims to accelerate the renovation of the Brussels building stock, of which **more than 70% of residential buildings date from before 1970**.

### What is blocked

In caretaker mode, existing grants continue to be processed within the limits of the approved budget. However:

- **No increase** in grant amounts despite inflation
- **No new programmes** targeting the most critical energy-inefficient buildings
- **Reduced available funding**: provisional twelfths do not allow for increased allocations
- **Longer waiting times**: processing delays have increased due to lack of additional administrative staff

The construction sector, which depends heavily on these grants for residential renovation, reports a slowdown in energy renovation projects.

### The Renolution backlog crisis

By the end of 2025, the Renolution payment backlog reached **42.2 million EUR** -- grants that had been approved but not paid to applicants, due to insufficient budget envelopes under provisional twelfths. Thousands of households that had undertaken renovation works on the basis of the promised grant are waiting for reimbursement, in some cases for months.

A collective of affected applicants, under the name **"Renillusion"**, has announced a class action lawsuit scheduled for **1 July 2026** if payments are not regularised. This crisis is undermining the credibility of the scheme and discouraging new renovation applications.

## The Air-Climate-Energy Plan (PACE) at a standstill

### Achievements

The PACE adopted in 2016, strengthened in 2019 and revised in 2023 enabled:

- The implementation of the EPB (Energy Performance of Buildings) certificate system
- The development of the district heating network
- The progressive extension of the Low Emission Zone (LEZ)
- Support for insulation of public buildings

### What requires a full government

- **New phases of the PACE**: the evaluation and revision of the plan for the 2025-2030 period requires a government decision
- **Binding sectoral targets**: the distribution of effort between buildings, transport and industry has not been updated
- **Transition financing**: multi-year funding envelopes cannot be committed under provisional twelfths
- **Coordination with the federal level**: the National Energy-Climate Plan (NECP) requires updated regional contributions

## Air quality: fragile progress

Air quality in Brussels has improved in recent years, notably thanks to the Low Emission Zone (LEZ) and the renewal of the vehicle fleet. According to IRCELINE data, NO2 levels at urban background stations measured around **21 µg/m3** in 2025, compared to more than 30 µg/m3 in 2019. The future EU 2030 limit is set at 20 µg/m3.

However, this progress relies on mechanisms already in place. Since **1 January 2026**, diesel Euro 5 vehicles have been banned from the LEZ, affecting approximately **225,000 vehicles**. This step, decided before the elections, was applied automatically.

Without new decisions:

- The **subsequent LEZ calendar** (diesel Euro 6 and petrol Euro 3, planned for 2030-2035) cannot be accelerated or adapted
- **Investment in public electric vehicle charging points** is stagnating
- The **conversion of STIB bus fleets** to electric depends on new budget decisions

## What continues to function

- **Brussels Environment**: emissions monitoring, air quality monitoring, environmental permits
- **LEZ**: the Low Emission Zone continues to apply according to the approved timetable
- **Renolution grants**: processing of applications within existing budget limits
- **IRCELINE monitoring network**: monitoring stations continue to operate

## Why this matters

Climate is the domain where lost time is most costly. With a -47% target by 2030, each year of delay in building renovation, energy transition and adaptation to urban heatwaves widens the gap between commitments made and the actual trajectory. Brussels, as one of the densest regions in Europe, is particularly vulnerable to heat islands and air pollution. Existing programmes maintain a minimum baseline, but without new political impetus, the 2030 target moves further away each month.
