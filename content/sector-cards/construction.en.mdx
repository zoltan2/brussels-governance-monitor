## Coalition Agreement: Announced Commitments
According to concordant press sources, the agreement of 12 February 2026 announces measures that would relaunch the construction sector on several fronts:

- **1,000+ public housing units** over the parliamentary term (SLRB, EUR 400M)
- **Neo (Heysel) relaunched** -- one of the largest Brussels urban projects resumes
- **Brownfield sites arbitrated**: 18-month moratorium on Keyenbempt, Calevoet, Josaphat, Meylemeersch; Wiels/Ajvil/Donderberg preserved; Chant des Cailles + Dames Blanches confirmed
- **Simplification of urban planning procedures** announced
- **Zero-interest loans** (EUR 200M) for renovation -- replacing the suppressed Renolution

The unlocking of PADs, strategic public contracts and regional permits will depend on the new government's first decisions. The sector emerges from 20 months of freeze.

## Sector context (February 2026)

The sector is going through its worst crisis in a decade. According to Embuild (the Belgian construction federation), Belgium faces the **"greatest construction and renovation challenge since the Second World War"**.

### Key figures

- **Net loss of 1,402 construction companies** in the Brussels-Capital Region in 2024 -- the first decline in ten years
- **Residential construction** fell by 7.3% in 2024 at national level
- **No recovery expected before 2026-2027** at the earliest (Embuild)
- Renovation grants (Renolution), frozen during the government formation, led to the cancellation or postponement of many private construction projects

### The brownfield dilemma

The 18-month moratorium announced in the agreement covers **9 brownfield sites** (Keyenbempt, Calevoet, Josaphat, Meylemeersch, etc.). According to an analysis by Moustique (9 February 2026), these sites represent **approximately 800 potential housing units** -- nearly a quarter of annual housing production in Brussels. Freezing these sites, even temporarily, worsens the shortage in an already tight market.

### Batibouw 2026

The annual construction trade fair was held under the theme "building and renovating despite the obstacles", reflecting the difficult climate for the sector.
