The Brussels-Capital Region is one of the three Regions that make up the Belgian federal state, alongside the Walloon Region and the Flemish Region. Created by the Special Law of 12 January 1989, it covers the territory of the 19 Brussels municipalities and is home to more than 1.2 million inhabitants, as well as the European institutions and numerous international organisations.

The Region has its own competences in spatial planning, mobility, the environment, housing, the economy, employment and public works. It exercises these competences through ordinances, voted by the Brussels Parliament and implemented by the regional government. Its institutional structure is unique in Belgium, with specific mechanisms to protect both linguistic communities.

The institutional complexity of Brussels, with the superposition of levels of power (Region, Communities, municipalities, public welfare centres, police zones), constitutes a permanent governance challenge. The Brussels Governance Monitor aims to make this complexity comprehensible and to track the impact of political crises on the functioning of the Region.
