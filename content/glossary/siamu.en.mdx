The SIAMU (Service d'Incendie et d'Aide Médicale Urgente), known in Dutch as DBDMH (Dienst voor Brandbestrijding en Dringende Medische Hulp), is the regional fire service of Brussels. It covers the 19 municipalities and responds to fires, accidents, technical rescues and medical emergencies (112 ambulances).

The February 2026 government agreement provides for a two-phase reinforcement of SIAMU staffing levels and an improvement in working conditions, in response to trade union warnings about understaffing.
