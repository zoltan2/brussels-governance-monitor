hub.brussels is the regional agency supporting Brussels economic activity. It assists entrepreneurs (creation, development, internationalisation), supports retailers through revitalisation programmes, and organises the international economic missions of the Brussels-Capital Region.

The February 2026 government agreement confirms the missions of hub.brussels and provides for its integration into the administrative reform of the regional pillars.
