## Context

The failure of the third formateur, just as the programme agreement was virtually finalised, sends a shockwave through Brussels public opinion. Citizens' movements mobilise to demand an end to the crisis. Simultaneously, parliamentarians from different parties launch cross-party initiatives to force a breakthrough.

## The current dynamic

Unlike previous rounds, this phase does not rely on the formal designation of a formateur or an informateur. It is characterised by a convergence of pressures:

### The respect.brussels collective

In late January 2026, the citizens' collective **respect.brussels** achieves a democratic coup: bringing together representatives of the **11 Brussels parties** around the same table. This unprecedented initiative is based on a simple observation -- citizens no longer accept the impasse -- and proposes a non-partisan framework for dialogue. The collective asks parties to commit publicly to a formation timetable and to minimum governance principles.

### Citizens' pressure

Demonstrations bring several thousand people onto the streets of Brussels. A petition for a "thematic emergency government" gathers a significant number of signatures. Citizens demand that parties set aside institutional disputes to address concrete emergencies: budget, housing, mobility.

### Parliamentary pressure

Parliamentarians from the potential majority table a resolution calling for the establishment of an emergency government with a mandate limited in time and scope. This cross-party initiative transcends the usual linguistic divides.

### Budgetary pressure

The approach of the second anniversary of provisional twelfths makes the budgetary situation untenable. Several public bodies report operational difficulties. The Court of Auditors publishes a warning on the deterioration of regional finances.

## Current situation

At the time of writing, this phase is still ongoing. No resolution is yet in sight, but the combined pressure from citizens, Parliament and budgetary reality creates a new dynamic that could lead to an unprecedented solution.
