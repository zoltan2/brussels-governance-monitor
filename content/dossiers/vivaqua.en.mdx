## Background

Vivaqua is the Brussels intermunicipal utility responsible for the production and distribution of drinking water as well as wastewater collection. Its pipeline network, spanning over 4,200 km, is largely outdated — some pipes date back to the 19th century.

The operator has developed an ambitious multi-year investment plan to progressively renew the network, improve resilience against extreme weather events, and reduce water losses.

## Impact of the Crisis

The caretaker government cannot:

- Approve the multi-year investment plan
- Authorise the tariff increases needed to fund the works
- Arbitrate priorities between network renewal and new infrastructure
- Guarantee Vivaqua's borrowings from financial institutions

Routine maintenance continues, but renewal investments are being deferred, worsening the network's deterioration.

## Key Issues

- **Public health**: an ageing network increases the risk of contamination
- **Water losses**: network leaks represent a significant waste of the resource
- **Climate resilience**: stormwater drainage infrastructure is undersized for the increasingly frequent episodes of heavy rainfall
