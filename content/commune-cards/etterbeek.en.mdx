## The European quarter municipality

Etterbeek has approximately 50,000 inhabitants on a compact territory of 3.15 km². Located in the heart of the European quarter, it hosts numerous institutions and an international population. Vincent De Wolf (MR) left his parliamentary mandate to focus on the mayoralty.

## Transparency: 5 out of 6 criteria

Etterbeek achieves an excellent transparency score. The **budget** and council **minutes** are published online, the council is broadcast via **livestream**, the **mandate registry** is accessible, and the municipality has a **citizen participation** platform via Fluicity with neighbourhood budgets (EUR 60,000). Only the **Open Data** portal is missing.

## Citizen participation: Fluicity and neighbourhood councils

Etterbeek uses the relaunched **Fluicity** platform for citizen participation, with active neighbourhood councils since 2020 and participatory budgets of EUR 60,000.
