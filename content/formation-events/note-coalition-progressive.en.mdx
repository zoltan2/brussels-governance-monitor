## What happened

On 25 June 2025, the second formateur tabled a detailed policy paper with the six parties of the expanded progressive coalition. This document represented the first attempt to formalise a government programme for this configuration.

## The content of the paper

The paper proposed a programme structured around four priority areas:

- **Housing**: creation of an emergency fund for affordable housing, acceleration of public housing production, strengthening of rent regulation
- **Mobility**: refinancing of public transport, continuation of the Good Move plan with adaptations, development of the cycling network
- **Employment**: reinforced activation plan, support for sectors facing shortages, vocational training
- **Climate**: acceleration of energy renovation of buildings, greening of public space, regional climate targets

## The reactions

The paper received a broadly positive reception from the six parties on the programmatic front. The broad orientations achieved a relative consensus. However, two crucial questions remained open:

1. The budgetary framework: how to finance these ambitions after more than a year of provisional twelfths?
2. The allocation of ministerial portfolios: who would manage which portfolio?

These two unresolved questions would become the blocking points in the weeks ahead.
