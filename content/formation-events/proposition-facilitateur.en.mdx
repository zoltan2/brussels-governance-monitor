## What happened

On 5 October 2025, the facilitator tabled a framework proposal with the two linguistic groups of the Brussels Parliament. This document represented the synthesis of six weeks of consultations and proposed a compromise on governance mechanisms.

## The content of the proposal

The framework proposal was built on three pillars:

1. **Guaranteed representation**: maintenance of existing constitutional guarantees for Dutch-speaking representation in the government, with a reinforced consultation mechanism on matters affecting both communities
2. **Decision-making**: introduction of a specific "alarm bell" procedure at the regional level for decisions directly affecting linguistic balances
3. **Proportionality**: preservation of the simple majority principle for routine decisions, in accordance with the demographic weight of the groups

## The reactions

The proposal received a mixed reception from both sides:

- **The French-speaking group** considered the minority protection mechanisms too constraining, potentially paralysing decision-making
- **The Dutch-speaking group** judged the guarantees insufficient and demanded a genuine veto right over a broader range of matters

The facilitator noted that positions, while closer, had not yet converged on the essentials.
