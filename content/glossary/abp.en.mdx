The ABP (Agence Bruxelles-Propreté), known in Dutch as ANB (Agentschap Net Brussel), is the regional body responsible for household waste collection and the cleanliness of public spaces in the 19 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region.

The February 2026 government agreement provides for a reform of the ABP, the creation of regional cleanliness brigades, the deployment of underground containers and the immediate collection of fines for illegal dumping.
