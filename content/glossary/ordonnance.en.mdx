The ordinance (French: ordonnance) is the legislative instrument specific to the Brussels-Capital Region, equivalent to what decrees are for the Walloon and Flemish Regions. It is voted by the Brussels Parliament and sanctioned by the regional government before being published in the Belgian Official Gazette. Ordinances have the force of law within the Region's areas of competence.

The Brussels legislative process provides that ordinances can be initiated either by the government (draft ordinances) or by members of parliament (ordinance proposals). They are examined in parliamentary committee before being voted in plenary session. Certain ordinances touching on the rights of linguistic groups may be subject to the alarm bell procedure.

During a caretaker period, legislative activity is severely reduced. The resigned government no longer submits new draft ordinances, and only parliamentary-initiative proposals can advance. This legislative paralysis is one of the most visible consequences of a prolonged formation crisis for Brussels residents.
