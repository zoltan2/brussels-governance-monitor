The rental deposit (French: garantie locative) is a sum of money that the tenant pays at the beginning of the lease as security for the fulfilment of their contractual obligations. In the Brussels-Capital Region, this matter is regulated by the Brussels Housing Code. The deposit amount is capped at two months' rent and must be placed in an individualised bank account in the tenant's name.

For low-income households, constituting this deposit can represent a major obstacle to accessing housing. That is why the Region has put in place assistance mechanisms, notably through the Housing Fund (Fonds du Logement) and Bruxelles Logement, which can stand as guarantors or grant loans to cover the deposit amount.

Improving the rental deposit system is a reform topic regularly raised in Brussels coalition negotiations. In the absence of a full government, legislative reform proposals remain in limbo, perpetuating the housing access difficulties for the Region's most vulnerable households.
