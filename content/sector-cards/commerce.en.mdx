## Local commerce, the vital fabric of Brussels

Commerce is an essential pillar of the Brussels economy and neighbourhood life. With approximately **60,000 commercial establishments** and **55,000 direct jobs** in retail, this sector runs through all 19 municipalities of the Region. From the major shopping streets (Rue Neuve, Avenue Louise, Chaussee d'Ixelles) to small neighbourhood shops, the Brussels commercial fabric is dense and diverse.

Regional commerce policy relies on several mechanisms: **revitalisation subsidies**, the **night economy strategy**, **commercial regulation** and the **regional commerce action plan**. These instruments are primarily managed by hub.brussels and Atrium Brussels.

Since 9 June 2024, the caretaker regional government can no longer take new decisions in these areas.

## Commercial revitalisation: struggling neighbourhoods without support

### The mechanism

Commercial revitalisation programmes aim to combat the decline of Brussels' commercial centres. They fund the renovation of empty retail units, support for struggling shopkeepers, improvement of public spaces around commercial areas and collective promotion of shopping neighbourhoods.

### What is blocked

With a vacancy rate estimated at approximately **15%** in the Brussels Region, the need for revitalisation remains significant. Under a caretaker government:

- **No new calls for projects** for the renovation of empty retail units
- **No funding** for new shopkeeper support programmes
- **No partnership agreements** with municipalities for revitalisation projects
- **No support** for shopkeeper associations to develop collective strategies

Some Brussels neighbourhoods, particularly in low-income areas, are seeing their commercial situation deteriorate in the absence of regional support.

## Night economy: a strategy on hold

### The stakes

Brussels has a rich nightlife that contributes to its attractiveness and generates significant economic activity: restaurants, bars, concert venues, clubs. The Region had begun developing a specific strategy to support and regulate this night economy, balancing economic activity, residents' peace and security.

### The consequences

- **No adoption** of the night economy strategy
- **No adapted regulatory framework** for nighttime activities
- **No structural mediation** between nighttime operators and residents
- **No funding** for adapted nighttime safety and cleanliness programmes

## Commercial regulation: modernisation on hold

The regulatory framework for Brussels retail was due to be modernised to adapt to sector developments: the rise of e-commerce, new forms of commerce (pop-up stores, dark kitchens), adaptation of trading hours. Under a caretaker government:

- The **planned regulatory updates** cannot be adopted
- The **administrative simplifications** promised to shopkeepers are postponed
- The **legal framework** for new forms of commerce remains unclear
- **Coordination** with the federal level on e-commerce issues stagnates

## Regional commerce action plan

The regional action plan coordinates all commerce support policies: shopkeeper training, digital support, promotion of Brussels artisans, commercial attractiveness. Under a caretaker government:

- **Renewal** of the expired plan is impossible
- **New support measures** cannot be launched
- **Coordination** between different institutional actors is limited to routine tasks
- **Budgets** cannot be reallocated to address sector emergencies

## What continues to function

### Commercial activity

Brussels shopkeepers continue their activities within the existing regulatory framework. The market functions normally, although the absence of an active support policy weakens the most vulnerable businesses.

### Existing permits

Commercial permits and authorisations issued before June 2024 remain fully valid. Renewal procedures within the framework of day-to-day management continue.

### Basic support

hub.brussels and Atrium Brussels continue to support shopkeepers and entrepreneurs with existing resources and programmes.

## Impact on the ground

The freeze on regional mechanisms has visible consequences in Brussels neighbourhoods:

- **Increasing vacancy**: without a revitalisation programme, struggling shopping streets deteriorate
- **Weakened neighbourhood commerce**: small independent shopkeepers lack support against online competition
- **Slowed digital transition**: shopkeepers wishing to digitalise lack guidance
- **Declining commercial attractiveness**: Brussels loses ground to better-supported peripheral commercial zones

## Outlook

Brussels commerce faces a structural transformation: the rise of e-commerce, evolving consumption habits, sustainability challenges. Without an active regional policy, this transformation is occurring at the expense of neighbourhood shops and the vitality of local areas.

The next regional government will need to relaunch commercial revitalisation programmes and adapt the regulatory framework to the sector's new realities, or risk increasing vacancy rates and deterioration of the local commercial fabric.
