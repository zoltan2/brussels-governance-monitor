## What happened

On 20 August 2025, the President of the Brussels Parliament designated a facilitator tasked with resolving the regional government formation crisis. Unlike the federal level, where the King plays a role in government formations, at the Brussels regional level the Parliament steers the entire process. The recourse to a facilitator -- distinct from a formateur or informateur -- was without precedent.

## Why a facilitator

The decision to resort to a facilitator was driven by the exhaustion of classical avenues:
- A formateur had failed (round 1)
- Informateurs had issued a recommendation (round 2)
- A second formateur had become bogged down (round 3)

The crisis had lasted over 14 months with no solution in sight. The recourse to a facilitator reflected the desire to step outside the usual framework with an actor whose mandate was limited to the structural question.

## The facilitator's mandate

The facilitator received a specific and limited mandate: to resolve the question of linguistic balances in regional governance, identified as the main lock preventing any formation. The task was not to negotiate a government programme, but to find an institutional framework acceptable to both linguistic groups.
