## Coalition Agreement: Announced Commitments

> **Note**: The official text of the Regional Policy Declaration (DPR) has not yet been published. The measures below are based on concordant press sources (RTBF, La Libre, DH, BX1, VRT NWS, BRUZZ). They will be updated once the official document is available.

The agreement of 12 February 2026 marks a major shift in mobility policy:

- **Good Move**: the name and plan as such are ended, replaced by a **new Regional Mobility Plan** with smaller zones (school perimeters)
- **Metro 3**: **frozen for 10 years**, replaced by a tram completing the loop of the existing network
- **Tram 15** (Gare du Nord -- Tour & Taxis): maintained
- **STIB construction sites**: Constitution and Palais du Midi continue
- **Car-free Sunday**: a second Sunday per year
- **LEZ**: maintained -- **annual pass at EUR 350** (reduced rate EUR 200), fine per violation reduced from 350 to **EUR 80**, 4-fine annual cap removed
- **STIB fares**: preferential youth/senior rates maintained
- **Contested bollards**: removal

The 10-year freeze on Metro 3 is the most structuring decision: it ends the project as conceived (extension to Bordet, EUR 4.6 billion) and redirects investment towards the tramway.

The following sections document the situation inherited from the political crisis (June 2024 -- February 2026).

## What is blocked

### Metro 3 — North-South Line

The Metro 3 project aims to create a new metro line connecting the north of Brussels (Bordet) to the south (Albert). The total cost of the project is now estimated at **EUR 4.6 billion**. The first construction phases (converting existing pre-metro to full metro between Albert and Gare du Nord) are underway, supported by a **EUR 475 million loan from the European Investment Bank** (EIB).

However, a **special commission of the Brussels Parliament** (end of 2025) revealed a **255% budget overrun** compared to the initial budget, with the delivery horizon pushed back to **2034 at the earliest**.

Furthermore, the **Council of State suspended the planning permit** for the demolition-reconstruction of the Palais du Midi (ruling of 18 December 2025). The Region had violated heritage protection rules by granting the permit before the heritage assessment. Works planned for February 2026 cannot proceed. The case was brought by ARAU and Inter-Environnement Bruxelles.

The extension to Bordet (the most ambitious part) requires new political decisions:

- Budget reassessment and financial sustainability review
- Approval of the definitive route north of Schaerbeek
- Coordination with Master Development Plans (PAD)

Without a full government, these decisions cannot be taken.

### Road tunnels -- the Loi-Belliard case

Brussels has more than 30 road tunnels, several of which require major renovation. The most emblematic case is the **Loi-Belliard tunnel**: planning permits have been obtained, the budget of **161 million EUR** has been identified, but the works cannot begin without a full government to commit the expenditure.

The Stephanie and Bailli tunnels are also among the priorities. Routine maintenance continues (carried out by the administration), but major structural renovation projects require:

- A multi-year budget commitment (envelopes of several tens of millions of euros per tunnel)
- A political choice on priorities
- Often, coordination with other projects (Good Move, cycling infrastructure)

### Good Move — Regional Mobility Plan

Good Move is the regional mobility plan adopted in 2020. The neighbourhood zones already implemented continue to function. However, **the rollout of new neighbourhood zones and adjustments based on citizen feedback** require government decisions. In caretaker mode, only minor adjustments are possible.

At the formation conclave (10 February 2026), MR and Les Engages announced their intention to **end the Good Move plan** in its current form. The measure is contested by Groen, which defends the plan. The anti-Good Move website launched by MR (7 February 2026) illustrates the political polarisation around the topic. The future of Good Move depends directly on the outcome of the formation negotiations.

## What continues to function

- **STIB**: daily operations (bus, tram, metro) continue normally under the 2024-2028 management contract. Fares increased by 1.23% on 1 February 2026 (single ride: EUR 2.40, annual pass: EUR 560)
- **Villo**: shared bicycle service under existing concession, but the **concession expires in September 2026** with no successor identified. Replacing the system requires a government decision
- **Jump/Lime**: shared scooter and electric bicycle services under concession
- **Routine road maintenance**: potholes, signage, traffic lights
- **Already approved works**: construction sites launched before June 2024 continue

### LEZ — Low Emission Zone

The Brussels Low Emission Zone (LEZ) imposes fines of **EUR 350** on non-compliant vehicles. This amount is contested by several parties at the conclave: a reduction is proposed, while maintaining the zone's principle. The Council of State is expected to issue a ruling by the end of February 2026 on the legality of the current fee schedule.

## Road congestion: the 2025 TomTom data

According to the TomTom Traffic Index (15th edition, 2025 data), a 10 km trip in Brussels takes an average of **32 minutes and 47 seconds**, 21 seconds more than in 2024. Brussels drivers lose an average of **146 hours per year** in traffic — 6 hours and 23 minutes more than in 2024, and 42 hours more than in 2023.

The congestion level (additional time compared to free flow) stands at **46.2%** (+1.3 percentage points). During the evening rush hour, this figure reaches 90.5%.

### Methodology change

Brussels' ranking varies significantly depending on the metric used. Ranked by absolute travel time, Brussels comes **15th worldwide**. Ranked by congestion percentage, it drops beyond 60th place in Europe. This discrepancy is explained by a triple change in the 2025 edition: new definition of urban perimeters (hexagonal grids), shift of the main ranking to congestion percentage, and expansion of the panel to approximately 500 cities.

Comparisons with previous years' rankings (when Brussels featured in the "global top 10") should be interpreted with caution: they do not reflect an improvement in traffic, but a change in measuring instrument.

The average speed in Brussels remains the lowest among Belgian cities (18.3 km/h), partly due to the generalised 30 km/h zone, the dense urban fabric, and the traffic light network.

## Why this matters

Mobility is the most visible domain for Brussels residents in their daily lives. Each day of delay in infrastructure projects has a cost:

- Economic cost (congestion, time lost)
- Environmental cost (delay in the transition to public transport)
- Social cost (accessibility of underserved neighbourhoods)

Precise data on these costs is difficult to estimate as it depends on complex modelling. BGM does not publish a quantified estimate of the economic cost of these delays to avoid unsourced speculation.
