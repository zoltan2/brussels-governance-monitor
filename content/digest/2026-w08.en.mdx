## Brussels Government Up and Running: First Measures and Institutional Tensions

The week was marked by the launch of the Brussels regional government and preparations for the presentation of the Regional Policy Statement (RPS) to Parliament. Minister-President Ahmed Laaouej (PS) held the first cabinet meeting on Thursday, 19 February, introducing initial budget measures: a hiring freeze, reduced consulting contracts, and cuts to discretionary grants, aiming to bring the deficit below one billion euros in 2026.

The RPS will be presented to the Brussels Parliament on Monday, 23 February at 16:30, followed by a confidence vote on 25 February. However, a language controversy persists: the delay in publishing the Dutch version of the RPS revives historical tensions around bilingualism in Brussels, stemming from constitutional debates in 1831, 1967 and 1991.

## Cleanliness: +61 % Rise in Fines for Illegal Dumping

Brussels Cleanliness' annual report reveals an intensification of efforts against illegal waste dumping: **7,731 fines** in 2025 (+61 %), totalling approximately **€12 million**. A concerning trend: **36.7 %** of these fines were issued to non-residents, revealing « waste tourism » linked to bag prices **10 times cheaper in Brussels** than in Wallonia. The Region plans underground containers and smart cameras to curb the practice.

## Employment: Fifth ONEM Wave and CPAS Capacity Risks

A new wave of ONEM (Belgian unemployment agency) benefit suspensions is underway: approximately **36,000 letters** have been sent nationally, affecting exclusions between July 2026 and July 2027. National total: **168,063 exclusions**, with **22.1 %** affecting Brussels residents (~**37,000** people). The Court of Auditors has confirmed that Brussels CPAS centres lack sufficient resources to absorb this influx, estimating necessary compensation at **€709.3 million** by 2029.

## Mobility: Two Regional Conflicts Over Stalled Plans

Two mobility dossiers crystallize tensions between the Region and municipalities. **Broustin Avenue (Jette)**: the municipality is demanding the Region reopen this avenue, closed since 2021-2022 as part of Good Move. **70 %** of residents oppose reopening, and legal action looms. **Three Fountains Viaduct (Auderghem)**: a permit has been filed to redesign the space beneath the viaduct (removing **60 parking spaces**), but Auderghem insists on its integration into the Hermann-Debroux Mobility Plan, a **€40 million** P+R scheme that has never been funded.

## Water and Sewerage: Vivaqua Under Budget Pressure

The Vivaqua dossier deteriorates: a **+12.5 %** tariff increase on 1 January 2026, contested by regulator BRUGEL, which points to mismanagement (**€73 million** in unpaid bills, **€35 million** in rejected costs). Cumulative debt approaches **€1 billion**. A recapitalization of **€180 million** has been announced (Region 49.99 %), alongside integration of Hydria. A series of sewer collapses reveals urgent renovation needs: **220 km** of pipes require renovation, necessitating **€70 million** annually.

## Site and Tools: New Domains and Enhanced Filters

Three new domains launched this week: **Urban Planning** (accelerated permits, urban amnesty, removal of CRMS approval requirement, Neo relaunched), **Digital** (digital divide, administrative simplification, smart city, positioning as AI capital) and **Education** (childcare places, school dropout, Cocof/VGC coordination). Simultaneously, the tagging system was enriched with **13 labels** (8 target groups: Seniors, Persons with Disabilities, Youth, Families, Newcomers, Homeless, Self-Employed, Tenants; 5 cross-cutting: Gender, Cost of Living, Precarity, Bilingualism, Civic Participation). A new domain filter was added to the sources registry: **262 sources** are now assigned to one or more domains.

Two new dossiers were also opened: **Accessibility and Disability** (**23,100** benefit recipients, **14,490** European Disability Cards, **55 of 69** metro stations accessible) and **Seniors in Brussels** (**163,000** people aged 65 or over, **11,592** care home residents, **8,596** APA files).
