The Metro 3 project is the largest infrastructure project in the Brussels-Capital Region. It plans the creation of a new metro line connecting the north (Bordet) to the south (Albert) of the Region, passing through the city centre. The project aims to relieve existing lines and offer an efficient public transport alternative for tens of thousands of daily commuters.

The financial scale of the project is considerable, with a budget estimated at several billion euros, regularly highlighted in reports by the Court of Audit. Financing relies primarily on the regional budget, making the project directly dependent on decisions by a full government. Under a provisional twelfths regime, the long-term financial commitments needed for the project cannot be made.

Metro 3 is an emblematic illustration of the concrete impact of a prolonged formation crisis on the daily lives of Brussels residents. Every delay in political decision-making translates into construction delays, cost overruns and the postponement of expected mobility improvements. It is a dossier that the Brussels Governance Monitor follows with particular attention.
