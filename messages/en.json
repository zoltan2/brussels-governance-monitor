    "backToHome": "Back to home",
    "questions": {
      "q1": "Why doesn't Brussels have a government?",
      "a1": "Since the regional elections of 9 June 2024, Brussels political parties have failed to form a majority coalition in parliament. Brussels' institutional structure, which requires majorities in both linguistic groups, complicates formation. Several attempts have failed due to disagreements over coalition formulas and the distribution of competences.",
      "q2": "What does 'caretaker government' mean?",
      "a2": "A caretaker government can only manage day-to-day matters and continue existing commitments. It cannot launch new policies, vote a new budget, or make strategic decisions. The budget is managed through provisional twelfths: each month, one twelfth of the previous budget is rolled over.",
      "q3": "What are the concrete impacts for residents?",
      "a3": "Infrastructure projects are frozen (Metro 3, tunnel renovations), housing policies are suspended (Housing Fund, rental guarantee), the job market suffers from inaction (ONEM exclusions), and the regional budget loses real value due to inflation without possible adjustment.",
      "q4": "Has this happened before in Belgium?",
      "a4": "At the federal level, yes. Belgium held the world record for the longest period without a government: 541 days between 2010 and 2011. At the Brussels regional level, the current situation is unprecedented in both duration and complexity.",
      "q5": "Who can unblock the situation?",
      "a5": "The Brussels political parties elected to the regional parliament. The King can also appoint formateurs, informateurs, or mediators to facilitate negotiations. As a last resort, new regional elections are theoretically possible but constitutionally near-impossible.",
      "q6": "What are provisional twelfths?",
      "a6": "An emergency budget mechanism that rolls over one twelfth of the last approved budget each month. This allows salaries and current expenses to be paid but prevents any new investment and any adjustment to inflation or changing needs.",
      "q7": "What are BGM's sources?",
      "a7": "All our data comes from official sources (Court of Auditors, Brussels parliament, regional administrations) or reliable secondary sources (press, academic studies). Every figure is accompanied by its source and confidence level. Everything is available on the Data page.",
      "q8": "Is BGM affiliated with a political party?",
      "a8": "No. Brussels Governance Monitor is an independent project hosted by Advice That SRL. It is not funded or supported by any political party, trade union, or interest group. The source code is published under the AGPL v3 licence to ensure full transparency.",
      "q9": "How can I contribute?",
      "a9": "You can report an error, propose a correction, or submit new sources via our GitHub repository. The source code is open and contributions are welcome. You can also subscribe to email alerts to follow the evolution of the situation.",
      "q10": "How long can this last?",
      "a10": "There is no legal limit to the duration of caretaker government in Belgium. The situation could theoretically last until the next regional elections scheduled for 2029. In practice, citizen pressure, media attention, and European budget deadlines could accelerate negotiations."

        "title": "The European Union",
        "role": "The EU does not govern Brussels, but it shapes a significant part of its environment. European funds (ERDF, ESF+) finance infrastructure and social cohesion projects. European directives set binding targets for air quality, energy efficiency, and the labour market. The European Semester assesses Belgian budgetary policies, including the situation in Brussels.",
        "impact": "Without a regional government, Brussels risks being unable to programme and spend European funds within the required deadlines. Some programmes require regional co-funding that the provisional twelfths mechanism cannot activate. The European Commission is monitoring the situation but has no direct lever to resolve it."

        "title": "The federal state",
        "competences": "The federal state manages social security (unemployment, pensions, healthcare), justice, the federal police, national taxation, railways (SNCB/NMBS), and defence. These competences directly impact Brussels residents: unemployment benefits, healthcare reimbursements, and the trains serving Brussels depend on the federal level, not the Region.",
        "asymmetry": "The federal government (Arizona coalition) has been operational since early 2025. It makes decisions that impact Brussels — tax reforms, refinancing of federated entities, cooperation agreements — without the Brussels Region having a fully empowered government to defend its interests in negotiations. This asymmetry is one of the most concrete consequences of the crisis."

      "regions": {
        "title": "The three Regions: an unprecedented asymmetry",
        "comparison": "Flanders and Wallonia formed their regional governments after the June 2024 elections. Brussels did not. This asymmetry creates a situation without precedent in Belgian history: two of three Regions can legislate, invest, and programme their policies, while the third operates on minimal management. On the same matters (housing, employment, mobility, environment), Flanders and Wallonia are moving forward while Brussels is falling behind.",
        "consequences": "Inter-regional cooperation agreements — necessary for issues such as commuter mobility or water management — are blocked on the Brussels side. Businesses active in multiple Regions face regulatory inconsistencies. Financial transfers between Regions continue on outdated parameters, with no possibility of renegotiation."

      "communities": {

        "cocom": "The COCOM/GGC (Joint Community Commission) manages bi-community matters in Brussels: hospitals, nursing homes, homeless shelters, health policy coordination. Its government consists of the same ministers as the regional government. Direct consequence: the COCOM is paralysed by the same crisis. Investments in health and social welfare are frozen.",
        "cocofVgc": "The COCOF (French Community Commission) manages French-speaking matters (culture, vocational training, personal assistance) and has its own budget. The VGC (Flemish Community Commission) fulfils the same role on the Dutch-speaking side but is structurally more linked to the Flemish government. During the regional crisis, the COCOF and VGC continue to function, but with constrained resources and without a regional strategic vision."

        "title": "The 19 municipalities: crisis shock absorbers",
        "role": "The 19 Brussels municipalities (City of Brussels, Ixelles, Schaerbeek, Molenbeek, Anderlecht, etc.) exercise proximity competences: urban planning, civil registry, local police, CPAS/OCMW (social welfare), municipal education, local roads. During a period without a regional government, the municipalities are often the only level of power that acts concretely for citizens in daily life.",
        "disparities": "But municipal resources are unequal. High-income municipalities (Uccle, Woluwe-Saint-Pierre) have solid tax revenues. Low-income municipalities (Molenbeek, Saint-Josse, Anderlecht) depend more on regional subsidies — subsidies that are frozen or reduced due to the absence of a new regional budget. The regional crisis deepens inequalities between municipalities."

      "provinces": {
        "title": "The absence of a province: a unique exception",
        "exception": "Brussels is the only Belgian Region without a province. In Flanders and Wallonia, provinces play a significant operational role: provincial education, cultural heritage, sports infrastructure, co-funding of local projects. In Brussels, the Region directly assumes these provincial competences, under the special law of 12 January 1989.",
        "consequence": "This absence means the Brussels Region carries a broader range of competences than the other two Regions. In normal times, this is an advantage (fewer intermediaries). In times of crisis, it is an additional handicap: there is no 'Brussels province' to take over certain matters when the Region is paralysed."

These bodies operate under multi-year management contracts and continue their missions during caretaker government.",
        "limits": "But 'continuing' is not 'advancing'. Management contracts expire without being renewed. New investments are blocked. Projects requiring a political decision — a new tram line, an energy renovation programme, an employment aid reform — are frozen. The bodies manage what exists; they cannot innovate."

The police operates independently of the regional crisis, but regional allocations for security are frozen at 2024 levels. Investments in equipment, recruitment, and police infrastructure are postponed."

        "description": "The blockage is concentrated at the level of the Brussels-Capital Region and the COCOM. These two levels — which share the same government — are the only ones without a fully empowered executive. The federal level, municipalities, para-regional bodies, and police zones continue to function. But they cannot compensate for the absence of a regional vision, investment budget, and legislative capacity. The Region is the strategic level: without it, the other levels manage day-to-day affairs without being able to prepare for the future."

On the French-speaking side, several combinations of 3-4 parties reach 37 seats. But on the Dutch-speaking side, with only 17 seats spread across 6 parties, finding 9 seats that are politically compatible with the French-speaking coalition is extremely difficult. It is this arithmetic constraint that explains the failure of the six rounds of formation."
