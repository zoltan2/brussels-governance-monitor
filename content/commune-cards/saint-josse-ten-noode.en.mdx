## Belgium's densest municipality

Saint-Josse-ten-Noode is the smallest (1.16 km²) and densest municipality in Belgium (~23,185 inhabitants/km²). After the **annulment** of the October 2024 elections due to irregularities (proxy voting), a new vote was held on 9 February 2025. Emir Kir (independent, ex-PS) reinforced his absolute majority to 18/29 seats (55.6%).

## Transparency: 3 out of 6 criteria

The **budget** is published online, the council has been broadcast via **livestream** on YouTube since 2018, and the **mandate registry** is accessible. Council **minutes** are partial (publication delays reported), **citizen participation** is limited to advisory councils, and there is no **Open Data** portal.

## A unique political context

The annulled and re-held elections constitute a unique case in the history of Brussels municipalities. The PS and Ecolo are excluded from any coalition by the outgoing mayor.
