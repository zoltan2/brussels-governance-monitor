## What happened

On Tuesday 10 and Wednesday 11 February 2026, the negotiators from the 7 parties continued discussions without interruption at the **University Foundation**. After a first day marked by tensions with Groen, the pace intensified with successive thematic sessions and overnight bilateral talks. Participants worked until 2 AM.

## Progress

According to several concordant sources, most chapters of the regional policy declaration (DPR) have been addressed. Partial agreements have reportedly been reached on:

- **The Low Emission Zone (LEZ)**: compromise underway on timeline and fines
- **Regional brownfields**: agreement in principle on vacant land management

## Sticking points

Three major issues remain unresolved:

1. **Budget equilibrium**: the savings trajectory of 1.3 billion euros by 2029 remains contested by Groen
2. **Good Move**: the mobility plan from the previous legislature could be abandoned or fundamentally reworked
3. **Groen's isolation**: the party remains under maximum pressure from the 6 other parties

## Quote

The formateur expressed hope of concluding by Thursday, stating: "Budget balance by 2029 is truly something essential."

RTBF summarised the situation: "We have never been closer to an agreement forming a Brussels government. And at the same time, we are still very far from it."

## Projected timeline

- **Thursday 12 February**: hoped-for agreement
- **Friday 13–14 February**: validation by party bureaus
- **Saturday 15 February**: meeting with the King for the future minister-president
