## What are provisional twelfths?

When a government is in caretaker mode, it cannot have a new budget approved by Parliament. The **provisional twelfths** mechanism applies: each month, the Region may spend a maximum of 1/12th of the last approved budget.

In practice, this means:

- **No new expenditure** beyond what was planned in the last budget (the 2024 budget, voted before the elections).
- **No new programmes** — any project that was not already budgeted is blocked.
- **Inflation is not compensated** — if prices rise, the real value of expenditure decreases automatically.

## The concrete impact

### Erosion through inflation

With cumulative inflation of approximately 6% between Q4 2023 budget design and early 2026 (based on Statbel indices), the 2026 provisional twelfths buy approximately 6% less than the original 2024 budget. Civil servants receive their indexed salary, but investments and subsidies remain at the 2024 nominal level.

### Frozen investments

Any investment that required a new political decision is at a standstill:

- No new funding envelopes for Master Development Plans (PAD)
- No refinancing of management contracts that have expired
- No new calls for projects in most regional administrations

### Subsidies and agreements

Multi-year agreements between the Region and subsidised organisations (associations, cultural institutions, etc.) that expire cannot be renewed by a caretaker government. Only existing commitments with a legal basis continue.

## Sources and methodology

The budget figures come from official documents of the Brussels Parliament and reports by the Court of Audit. The estimate of the real loss due to inflation is calculated by BGM based on consumer price indices published by Statbel and the National Bank of Belgium. This estimate uses the simplifying assumption of a constant nominal budget, which underestimates the real impact (certain items such as salaries are indexed automatically, which correspondingly reduces the margins for other expenditure).
