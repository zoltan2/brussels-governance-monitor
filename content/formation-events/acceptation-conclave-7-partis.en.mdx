## What happened

On 9 February 2026, all 7 parties invited by the MR president respond positively to the call for a "finish conclave". Acceptances cascade in rapid succession:

- **Les Engagés** immediately confirm their availability
- **Groen** confirms participation
- **CD&V** accepts
- **Anders** accepts under "strict conditions": separate Dutch-speaking majority, budget balance by 2029, tax relief for the middle class, institutional simplification, enhanced security
- **PS** says "yes" after a political bureau meeting, with Ahmed Laaouej declaring: "This appears to be an excellent method we haven't yet experimented with"
- **Vooruit** describes itself as "constructive"

## The decisive turning point: Anders drops the N-VA

The critical fact is the reversal by **Frederic De Gucht** (Anders). After refusing three times to negotiate without the N-VA, he accepts this time to take a seat at the table without any precondition of N-VA participation.

Behind the scenes, budget minister **Dirk De Smedt** (Anders) had negotiated preliminary budget agreements with the PS, creating common ground between Laaouej and De Gucht. De Gucht stated: "I note that with the N-VA it was not possible" and "There is a difference between being right and getting what you want."

## The N-VA reaction

**Cieltje Van Achter** (N-VA) decries the exclusion of her party: "Laaouej has won". She labels the coalition in formation a "Brussels Vivaldi government" and claims the PS determines the coalition composition on the Flemish side.

## CRISP analysis

**Jean Faniel** (CRISP director) expresses a reservation: he describes the approach as "putting the cart before the horse", arguing that conclaves generally work best as "landing solutions" when substantial agreements already exist.

## What this means

The unanimous acceptance by all 7 parties marks a major turning point in the crisis. It is the first time in more than 610 days that a configuration with a double linguistic majority agrees to a binding negotiation format. The conclave is announced for the following day at the University Foundation.
