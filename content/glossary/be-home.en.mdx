The BE HOME premium is a Brussels fiscal mechanism that allows owners occupying their home in the Brussels-Capital Region to benefit from a reduction in their property tax. The objective is to curb the fiscal exodus of Brussels households to Flanders and Wallonia.

The government agreement of February 2026 provides for the **doubling** of this premium, which would make it one of the main levers of the Region's residential attractiveness policy.
