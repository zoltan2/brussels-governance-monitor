## Government agreement: announced impacts

According to concordant press sources, the agreement of 12 February 2026 contains several measures that affect the commercial sector:

- **New mobility plan** replacing Good Move: the revision of traffic layouts will affect commercial areas located in redesigned neighbourhood cells. The impact on shop accessibility will be a central issue
- **LEZ maintained with an annual pass** (EUR 350, social rate EUR 200): shopkeepers and their suppliers using non-compliant vehicles will benefit from a predictable cost instead of per-infraction fines
- **Renolution grants removed** in their current form: businesses that benefited from these grants for the energy renovation of their buildings lose this instrument
- **Personal income tax cut by 1%** and increase in the registration fee abatement ceiling (EUR 600,000 to EUR 800,000): these fiscal measures aim to strengthen the residential attractiveness of Brussels, which indirectly supports local commerce

**Point of attention**: the end of the caretaker period allows the relaunch of commercial revitalisation programmes, the night economy strategy and the modernisation of the regulatory framework. The budgetary effort will determine the scale of resources allocated to these relaunches.

## State of the commercial fabric (February 2026)

### Commercial vacancy: 13.5%

According to hub.brussels, the average commercial vacancy rate stands at **13.5%** in the Brussels Region, representing **3,500 vacant units**. The geographical distribution shows a centre-periphery gradient:

| Zone | Vacancy rate |
|------|-------------|
| Pentagon (city centre) | **18.3%** |
| First ring | **13.9%** |
| Second ring | **10.7%** |

### Horeca: overrepresentation in bankruptcies

The horeca sector accounts for only **6% of SMEs** in Brussels, but concentrates **17% of bankruptcies** — nearly 3 times its share of the economy. The succession of crises (COVID, inflation, staff shortages, regulations) has deeply affected this sub-sector.

### Impact of regional austerity

The **EUR 1 billion** budget effort announced by the new government will affect public bodies, including hub.brussels and Atrium Brussels which run the commerce support programmes. Commercial revitalisation funding could be reduced while needs are increasing.
