## The agreement

On Thursday 12 February 2026, in the late afternoon, negotiators from the 7 parties (MR, PS, Les Engagés on the French-speaking side; Groen, Anders, Vooruit, CD&V on the Dutch-speaking side) announced the conclusion of a government agreement for the Brussels-Capital Region. The white smoke puts an end to **613 days of caretaker government** — the longest political crisis in the Region's history.

## Key measures

- **Budget**: trajectory to balance by 2029, cumulative effort of approximately EUR 1 billion over the legislative term
- **Mobility**: Good Move replaced by a new mobility plan (new name, fundamental overhaul focused on road safety and quality of life around schools)
- **Metro 3**: construction halted, replaced by a tram completing the loop
- **Renolution subsidies**: scrapped in their current form
- **Vivaqua and SLRB**: financial consolidation of both institutions
- **LEZ**: fines reduced
- **Security**: creation of a regional drug commissioner
- **Employment**: stricter activation policy for jobseekers
- **Brownfields**: agreement on developing vacant land for housing
- **Bilingualism**: raised ambitions

## Next steps

1. **Thursday evening**: party participation congresses (MR at Albert Hall, 8:30 PM)
2. **Allocation of ministerial portfolios** between parties
3. **Friday or Saturday 14-15 February**: designation of ministers by the Brussels Parliament and oath-taking before the King (constitutional formality)

## Coalition

The coalition brings together **55 out of 89 members** of the Brussels Parliament, with a double linguistic majority: 46 seats out of 72 on the French-speaking side and 9 out of 17 on the Dutch-speaking side.
