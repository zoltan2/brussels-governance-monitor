## Coalition Agreement: Announced Commitments

> **Note**: The official text of the Regional Policy Declaration (DPR) has not yet been published. The measures below are based on concordant press sources (RTBF, La Libre, DH, BX1, VRT NWS, BRUZZ). They will be updated once the official document is available.

According to concordant press sources, the agreement concluded on 12 February 2026 between the seven parties of the new Brussels majority announces an ambitious budgetary framework:

- **Return to a balanced budget by 2029** — trajectory of ~EUR 1.2 billion in savings, split 80% spending cuts and 20% new revenue
- **No new taxes** — no City Tax, no kilometre charge
- **One-point reduction in regional personal income tax** — estimated gain of ~EUR 268/year per Brussels worker
- **Registration duties** — exemption threshold raised from EUR 600,000 to EUR 800,000
- **Administrative reform** — merger of 25 regional structures into 3 entities (BOSA Brussels, etc.) with a 20 to 30% reduction in operational costs
- **Hiring freeze** in the regional civil service (no layoffs)
- **Discretionary subsidies** — systematic review of all funding envelopes

If confirmed, these commitments would mark the end of provisional twelfths and the beginning of a fiscal recovery trajectory. Their implementation will depend on the 2026 budget that the new government must present to the Brussels Parliament.

The following sections document the situation inherited from the political crisis (June 2024 -- February 2026). This data remains relevant as baseline context and tracking indicators for the commitments made.

## What are provisional twelfths?

When a government is in caretaker mode, it cannot have a new budget approved by Parliament. The **provisional twelfths** mechanism applies: each month, the Region may spend a maximum of 1/12th of the last approved budget.

In practice, this means:

- **No new expenditure** beyond what was planned in the last budget (the 2024 budget, voted before the elections).
- **No new programmes** — any project that was not already budgeted is blocked.
- **Inflation is not compensated** — if prices rise, the real value of expenditure decreases automatically.

## The concrete impact

### Erosion through inflation

With cumulative inflation of approximately 6% between Q4 2023 budget design and early 2026 (based on Statbel indices), the 2026 provisional twelfths buy approximately 6% less than the original 2024 budget. Civil servants receive their indexed salary, but investments and subsidies remain at the 2024 nominal level.

### Frozen investments

Any investment that required a new political decision is at a standstill:

- No new funding envelopes for Master Development Plans (PAD)
- No refinancing of management contracts that have expired
- No new calls for projects in most regional administrations

### Regional debt sharply rising

The Court of Auditors issued an **adverse opinion** on the Region's 2024 accounts, citing "significant anomalies". The consolidated gross debt has tripled since 2016, rising from 4.6 to **15.65 billion EUR**. Annual interest charges have increased 4.4-fold: from 91 million in 2016 to **399 million EUR** in 2024, with a projected 548 million by 2029. According to S&P Global Ratings, interest charges reach **415 million EUR** per year in 2025. The gap between the projected deficit (-1.080B) and the actual deficit (-1.515B) in 2024 was 434.8 million EUR.

### Shutdown risk narrowly averted

At the end of 2025, Belfius -- the Region's main creditor -- had announced the end of its credit line on 1 January 2026. The contract was ultimately extended by one year (50 million EUR). Without this extension, the Region would no longer have been able to pay its civil servants and maintain basic services.

The scale of the financial tightening is considerable: **Belfius withdrew 500 million EUR** in credit lines, and **ING let 500 million EUR** expire on 1 January 2026. In total, the Region lost approximately **1 billion EUR in borrowing capacity** within a few months. S&P Global Ratings confirmed the Region's **A** rating in June 2025, but with a **negative outlook** -- a warning signal for financial markets.

### 19 municipalities in difficulty

The budget impact is cascading down to the 19 Brussels municipalities, described as being in "slow financial agony". Without a regional government to redistribute grants and refinance solidarity mechanisms, the most vulnerable municipalities see their margins shrinking. Municipal public welfare centres (CPAS), already under pressure from unemployment reform, are absorbing a growing burden without additional resources.

### Subsidies and agreements

Multi-year agreements between the Region and subsidised organisations (associations, cultural institutions, etc.) that expire cannot be renewed by a caretaker government. Only existing commitments with a legal basis continue.

### The conclave's target (February 2026)

The formation conclave opened on 10 February 2026 set an ambitious budget framework: a **return to balanced budget by 2029**, requiring approximately **EUR 1 billion in savings** over more than three years (~EUR 350 million per year). This figure illustrates the scale of the recovery needed, in a context where debt has tripled and interest charges continue to grow.

## Sources and methodology

The budget figures come from official documents of the Brussels Parliament and reports by the Court of Audit. The estimate of the real loss due to inflation is calculated by BGM based on consumer price indices published by Statbel and the National Bank of Belgium. This estimate uses the simplifying assumption of a constant nominal budget, which underestimates the real impact (certain items such as salaries are indexed automatically, which correspondingly reduces the margins for other expenditure).
