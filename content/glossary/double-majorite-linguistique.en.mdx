The dual linguistic majority is a constitutional mechanism specific to the Brussels-Capital Region. For certain strategic decisions, a vote in the Brussels Parliament must obtain a majority not only overall, but also a separate majority in each of the two linguistic groups: the French-speaking group (72 seats) and the Dutch-speaking group (17 seats).

This mechanism was designed to protect the Dutch-speaking minority of Brussels, but it has a major structural effect: it makes the formation of a Brussels government considerably more complex than at the federal level or in the other Regions. A coalition must hold a majority in both groups, which drastically limits the possible combinations.

In the context of the 2024-2026 formation crisis, the dual linguistic majority has been identified as the main structural lock. French-speaking parties have numerous majority combinations available, but finding a simultaneous majority on the Dutch-speaking side restricts the options to just a few configurations.
