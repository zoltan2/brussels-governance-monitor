Brupartners (formerly the Economic and Social Council of the Brussels-Capital Region — CESRBC) is the joint advisory body for socio-economic consultation in the Brussels Region. It issues opinions to the Brussels government and Parliament on economic, social and employment matters.

## Composition

The plenary assembly has 15 full members and 15 alternates, divided into three benches:

- **Trade union bench** (15 seats): FGTB (6), CSC (6), CGSLB (3)
- **Employer bench**: BECI (Brussels Enterprises Commerce & Industry), UCM (Union des Classes Moyennes)
- **Non-profit sector**: BRUXEO (federation of Brussels non-profit employers)

The CGSLB (General Confederation of Liberal Trade Unions of Belgium) is the second-largest trade union in the Brussels Region. It holds 3 seats within Brupartners, reflecting its strong presence in the tertiary sector and SMEs.

## Role

Brupartners issues opinions on draft ordinances, strategic plans and regional policies. In June 2025, it published an urgent call identifying 10 priority measures for the Region, including the creation of an Employment Task Force.
