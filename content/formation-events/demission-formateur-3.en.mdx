## What happened

On 20 January 2026, the third formateur submitted a letter of resignation to the President of the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region. Ten days after the Dutch-speaking partner's refusal, efforts to salvage the "Guinness" agreement had failed.

## The final attempts

Between 10 and 20 January 2026, the formateur attempted to save the mission:

- Last-ditch contacts with the reluctant partner
- Exploration of a variant of the "Guinness" coalition with another Dutch-speaking partner
- Consultations with the President of Parliament on the remaining options

None of these avenues produced results within the allotted timeframe. The formateur acknowledged the impossibility of forming a government and submitted a resignation.

## The assessment

The third formateur's record is paradoxical:
- **Programmatic success**: the "Guinness" paper represents the most comprehensive and consensual government programme produced during this crisis
- **Political failure**: despite this substance, the agreement stumbled on the institutional question that has haunted the formation process from day one

## What changes

This resignation marked a turning point. For the first time, the Brussels crisis moved beyond the framework of traditional political manoeuvring. Public opinion, relatively patient until then, shifted to exasperation. Citizen voices began to be heard, calling for a radically different approach.
